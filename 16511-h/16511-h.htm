  of Britaine, who was crowned with a golden crowne, his lawes, his
  foundations, with other his acts and deeds.</i></p>

  <h3>THE FIRST CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p><span class="rightnote">MULMUCIUS. <i>Matth. West.
  Polyd.</i></span> Now to proceede with the aforesaid authors,
  Mulmucius Dunwall&#333;, or as other saie Dunuallo Mulmucius, the
  sonne of Cloton (as testifieth th'english chronicle and also Geffrey
  of Monmouth) got the vpper hand of the other dukes or rulers: and
  after his fathers deceasse began his reigne ouer the whole monarchie
  of Britaine, in the yéere of the world 3529, after the building of
  Rome 314, and after the deliuerance of the Israelites out of
  captiuitie 97, and about the 26 yéere of Darius Artaxerxes
  Longimanus, the fift king of the Persians. This Mulmucius Dunuallo is
  named in the english chronicle Donebant, and prooued a right worthie
  prince. He builded within the citie of London then called Troinouant,
  <span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i> See more in the
  description.</span> a temple, and named it the temple of peace: the
  which (as some hold opinion, I wote not vpon what ground) was the
  same which now is called Blackwell hall, where the market for buieng
  and selling of cloths is kept. The chronicle of England affirmeth,
  that Mulmucius <span class="leftnote">Malmesburie and the Vies built.
  <br />
  <i>Matth. West.</i> Lawes made.</span> (whome the old booke nameth
  Molle) builded the two townes Malmesburie and the Vies. He also made
  manie good lawes, which were long after vsed, called Mulmucius lawes,
  turned out of the British spéech into the Latine by Gildas Priscus,
  and long time after translated out of latine into english by Alfred
  king of England, and mingled in his statutes. He moreouer gaue
  priuileges to temples, to plowes, to cities, and to high waies
  leading to the same, so that whosoeuer fled to them, should be in
  safegard from bodilie harme, and from <span class=
  "rightnote"><i>Caxton</i> and <i>Polychron</i>.</span> thence he
  might depart into what countrie he would, with indemnitie of his
  person. Some authors write, that he began to make the foure great
  high waies of Britaine, the which were finished by his sonne Blinus,
  as after shall be declared.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">The first king that was crowned with a
  golden crowne.</span> After he had established his land, and set his
  Britains in good and conuenient order, he ordeined him by the aduise
  of his lords a crowne of gold, &amp; caused himselfe with great
  solemnitie to be crowned, according to the custome of the pagan lawes
  then in vse: &amp; bicause he was the first that bare a crowne héere
  in Britaine, after the opinion of some writers, he is named the first
  king of Britaine, and all the other before rehearsed are named
  rulers, dukes, or gouernors.</p>

  <p><span class="leftnote"><i>Polyd.</i> Weights and measures.</span>
  Amongst other of his ordinances, he appointed weights and measures,
  with the which men should buy and sell. And further he deuised sore
  and streight orders for the punishing <span class="rightnote">Theft
  punished. <i>Fabian.</i></span> of theft. Finallie, after he had
  guided the land by the space of fortie yéeres, he died, and was
  buried in the foresaid temple of peace which he had erected within
  the citie of Troinouant now called London, as before ye haue heard,
  appointing in his life time, that his <span class="page">[<a name=

  Belinus and Brennus the two sonnes of Mulmucius, their
  discontentment, the stratagems of the one against the other, the

  <h3>THE SECOND CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p><span class="rightnote">Belinus and Brennus. 3574.</span> Brennus
  and Belinus began to reigne iointlie as kings in Britaine, in the
  yéere of the world 3574, after the building of the citie of Rome 355,
  and after the deliuerance of the Israelites out of captiuitie 142,
  which was about the seuenth yéere of Artaxerxes surnamed <span class=
  "leftnote"><i>Matth. West.</i></span> Mnenon, the seuenth king of the
  Persians. Belinus held vnder his gouernment Loegria, Wales, and
  Cornwall: and Brennus all those countries ouer and beyond Humber. And
  <span class="rightnote"><i>Polyd.</i> saith 5.</span> with this
  partition were they contented by the tearme of six or seuen yéeres,
  after which <span class="leftnote">Brennus not content with his
  portion.</span> time expired, Brennus coueting to haue more than his
  portion came to, first thought to purchase himselfe aid in forreine
  parties, &amp; therefore by the prouocation and counsell of yong
  <span class="rightnote">Elsingius.</span> vnquiet heads, sailed ouer
  into Norway, and there married the daughter of Elsung or Elsing, as
  then duke or ruler of that countrie. Beline, offended with his
  brother, that he should thus without his aduice marrie with a
  stranger, now in his absence seized all his lands, townes, and
  fortresses into his owne hands, placing garisons of men of warre
  where he thought conuenient.</p>

  <p>In the meane time, Brenne aduertised hereof, assembled a great
  nauie of ships, well furnished with people and souldiers of the
  Norwegians, with the which he tooke his course <span class=
  "rightnote">Guilthdacus king of Denmarke.</span> homewards, but in
  the waie he was encountred by Guilthdacus king of Denmarke, the which
  had laid long in wait for him, bicause of the yoong ladie which
  Brenne had maried, for whome he had béene a sutor to hir father
  Elsing of long time. When these two fléetes of the Danes and
  Norwegians met, there was a sore battell betwixt them, but finallie
  the Danes ouercame them of Norway, and tooke the ship wherein the new
  bride was conueied, and then was she brought aboord the ship of
  Guilthdacus. Brenne escaped by flight as well as he might. But when
  Guilthdacus had thus obtained the victorie and prey, suddenlie
  therevpon <span class="rightnote">A tempest.</span> arose a sore
  tempest of wind and weather, which scattered the Danish fleete, and
  put the king in danger to haue béene lost: but finallie within fiue
  daies after, being driuen by <span class="leftnote">Guilthdacus
  landed in the north.</span> force of wind, he landed in
  Northumberland, with a few such ships as kept togither with him.</p>

  <p>Beline being then in that countrie, prouiding for defense against
  his brother, vpon knowledge of the king of Denmarks arriuall, caused
  him to be staied. Shortlie after, Brenne hauing recouered and gotten
  togither the most part of his ships that were dispersed by the
  discomfiture, and then newlie rigged and furnished of all things
  necessarie, sent word to his brother Beline, both to restore vnto him
  his wife wrongfullie rauished by Guilthdacus, and also his lands
  iniuriouslie by him seized into his possession. These requests being
  plainlie and shortlie denied, Brenne made no long delaie, but
  spéedilie made toward Albania, and landing with his armie in a part
  thereof, incountred with his brother Beline néere vnto a wood named
  <span class="rightnote">Calater wood is in Scotland.</span> as then
  Calater, where (after cruell fight, and mortall battell betwixt them)
  at length the victorie abode with the Britains, and the discomfiture
  did light so on the Norwegians, that the most of them were wounded,
  slaine, and left dead vpon the ground.</p>

  <p>Hereby Brenne being forced to flée, made shift, and got ouer into
  Gallia, where after he <span class="rightnote">Seguinus or Seginus
  duke of the Allobrogs, now the Delphinat of Sauoy.</span> had sued to
  this prince, at length he abode, and was well receiued of one
  Seguinus or Seginus duke of the people called then Allobrogs (as
  Galfrid of Monmouth saith) or rather Armorica, which now is called
  Britaine, as Polychronicon, and the english historie printed by
  Caxton, more trulie maie seeme to affirme. But Beline hauing got the
  vpper hand of his enimies, assembling his councell at Caerbranke, now
  called York, tooke aduise what he should doo with the king of
  Denmarke: where it was ordeined, that he should be set at<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page453" id="page453">Page 453</a>]</span> libertie,
  with condition and vnder couenant, to acknowledge himselfe by dooing
  homage, <span class="rightnote">The Danes tributarie of the
  Britains.</span> to hold his land of the king of Britaine, and to
  paie him a yéerelie tribute. These couenants being agréed vpon, and
  hostages taken for assurance, he was set at libertie, and so returned
  into his countrie. The tribute that he couenanted to paie, was a
  thousand pounds, as the English chronicle saith.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">The foure high waies finished.</span> When
  Beline had thus expelled his brother, and was alone possessed of all
  the land of Britaine, he first confirmed the lawes made by his
  father: and for so much as the foure waies begun by his father were
  not brought to perfection, he therefore caused workmen to be called
  foorth and assembled, whom he set in hand to paue the said waies with
  stone, for the better passage and ease of all that should trauell
  through the countries from place to place, as occasion should
  require.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  The Fosse.</span> The first of these foure waies is named Fosse, and
  stretcheth from the south into the north, beginning at the corner of
  Totnesse in Cornewall, and so passing foorth by Deuonshire, and
  Somersetshire, by Tutherie, on Cotteswold, and then forward beside
  Couentrie vnto Leicester, and from thence by wild plaines towards
  Newarke, and endeth at the citie of Lincolne. <span class=
  "leftnote">Watling stréet.</span> The second waie was named Watling
  stréete, the which stretcheth ouerthwart the Fosse, out of the
  southeast into the northeast, beginning at Douer, and passing by the
  middle of Kent ouer Thames beside London, by-west of Westminster, as
  some haue thought, and so foorth by S. Albons, and by the west side
  of Dunstable, Stratford, Toucester, and Wedon by-south of Lilleborne,
  by Atherston, Gilberts hill, that now is called the Wreken, and so
  foorth by Seuerne, passing beside Worcester, vnto Stratton to the
  middle of Wales, and so vnto a place called Cardigan, at the Irish
  sea. The third way <span class="rightnote">Erming streét.</span> was
  named Ermingstréet, which stretched out of the west northwest, vnto
  the east southeast, and beginneth at Meneuia, the which is in Saint
  Dauids land in west Wales, and so vnto Southampton.</p>

  <p><span class="leftnote">Hiknelstréet.</span> The fourth and last
  waie hight Hiknelstréete, which leadeth by Worcester, Winchcombe,
  Birmingham, Lichfield, Darbie, Chesterfield, and by Yorke, and so
  foorth vnto Tinmouth. <span class="rightnote">Priuilegs granted to
  the waies.</span> After he had caused these waies to be well and
  sufficientlie raised and made, he confirmed vnto them all such
  priuileges as were granted by his father.</p>

  <h3>THE THIRD CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>In the meane time that Beline was thus occupied about the
  necessarie affaires of his realme and kingdome, his brother Brenne
  that was fled into Gallia onelie with 12. persons, bicause he was a
  goodlie gentleman, and séemed to vnderstand what apperteined to
  honour, grew shortlie into fauour with Seginus the duke afore
  mentioned, and declaring vnto him his aduersitie, and the whole
  circumstance of his mishap, at length was so highlie cherished of the
  said Seginus, deliting in such worthie qualities as he saw in him
  dailie appearing, that he <span class="rightnote">Brenne marieth the
  duke of Alobrogs daughter.</span> gaue to him his daughter in
  mariage, with condition, that if he died without issue male, should
  he inherit his estate &amp; dukedome: and if it happened him to leaue
  anie heire male behind him, then should he yet helpe him to recouer
  his land and dominion in Britaine, béereft from him by his
  brother.</p>

  <p>These conditions well and surelie vpon the dukes part by the
  assent of the nobles of his land concluded, ratified, and assured,
  the said duke within the space of one yéere after died. And then
  after a certeine time, being knowne that the duches was not with
  child, all the lords of that countrie did homage to Brenne, receiuing
  him as their lord and supreme gouernour, vpon whome he likewise for
  his part in recompense of their curtesie, bestowed<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page454" id="page454">Page 454</a>]</span> a great
  portion of his treasure.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">Brenne with an armie returneth into
  Britaine.</span> Shortlie after also, with their assent he gathered
  an armie, and with the same eftsoones came ouer into Britaine, to
  make new warre vpon his brother Beline. Of whose landing when Beline
  was informed, he assembled his people, and made himselfe readie to
  méete <span class="leftnote">Brenne and Beline made friends by
  intercession of their mother.</span> him: but as they were at point
  to haue ioined battell, by the intercession of their mother that came
  betwixt them, and demeaned hirselfe in all motherlie order, and most
  louing maner towards them both, they fell to an agréement, and were
  made friends or euer they parted asunder.</p>

  <p>After this they repaired to London, and there taking aduice
  togither with their peeres and councellors, for the good order and
  quieting of the land, at length they accorded to passe with both
  their armies into Gallia, to subdue that whole countrie, and so
  following this determination, they tooke shipping and sailed ouer
  into Gallia, where beginning the warre with fire and sword, they
  wrought such maisteries, that within a short time (as saith Geffrey
  of <span class="rightnote">They inuade Gallia and Italie.</span>
  Monmouth) they conquered a great part of Gallia, Italie, and
  Germanie, and brought it to their subiection. In the end they tooke
  Rome by this occasion (as writers report) if these be the same that
  had the leading of those Galles, which in this season did so much
  hurt in Italie and other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>After they had passed the mountaines, &amp; were entred into
  Tuscan, they besieged the citie <span class="leftnote">Now
  Clusi.</span> of Clusium, the citizens whereof being in great danger,
  sent to Rome for aid against their enimies. Wherevpon the Romanes,
  considering with themselues that although they were not in anie
  league of societie with the Clusians, yet if they were ouercome the
  danger of the next <span class="rightnote">Ambassadours sent from
  Rome. Brennus answere.</span> brunt were like to be theirs: with all
  spéed they sent ambassadours to intreat betwixt the parties for some
  peace to be had.</p>

  <p>They that were sent, required the capteines of the Galles, in the
  name of the senat and citizens of Rome, not to molest the friends of
  the Romans. Wherevnto answere was made by Brennus, that for his part
  he could be content to haue peace, if it were so that the Clusians
  would be agréeable that the Galles might haue part of the countrie
  which they held, being more than they did alreadie well occupie, for
  otherwise (said he) there could be no peace granted.</p>

  <p>The Romane ambassadours being offended with these wordes, demanded
  what the Galles had to doo in Tuscan, by reason of which and other
  the like ouerthwart wordes, the parties <span class="rightnote">The
  treatie of peace breaketh off.</span> began to kindle in displeasure
  so farre, that their communication brake off, and so they from
  treating fell againe to trie the matter by dint of sword.</p>

  <p>The Romane ambassadours also to shew of what prowesse the Romans
  were, contrarie to the law of nations (forbidding such as came in
  ambassage about anie treatie of peace to take either one part or
  other) tooke weapon in hand, and ioined themselues with the Clusians,
  wherewith the Galles were so much displeased, that incontinentlie
  with one voice, they required to haue the siege raised from Clusium,
  that they might go to Rome. But Brennus thought good first to send
  messengers thither, to require the deliuerie of such as had broken
  the law, that punishment might be done on them accordinglie as they
  had deserued. This was done, and knowledge brought againe, that the
  ambassadors were not onelie not punished, but also chosen to be
  tribunes for the next yeare.</p>

  <p>The Galles then became in such a rage (because they saw there was
  nothing to be looked <span class="rightnote">The Galles make towards
  Rome. The Romans incountring with the Galles are overthrown.</span>
  for at the hands of the Romans, but warre, injurious wrongs, and
  deceitfull traines) that they turned all their force against them,
  marching streight towardes Rome, and by the waie destroied all that
  stood before them. The Romans aduertised thereof, assembled
  themselues togither to the number of 40. thousand, and encountring
  with Beline and Brenne, neare to the riuer Allia, about 11. miles on
  this side Rome, were slaine and quite discomfited.</p>

  <p>The Galles could scarse beléeue that they had got the victorie
  with so small resistance: but when they perceiued that the Romans
  were quite ouerthrowne and that the field was clearelie rid of them,
  they got togither the spoile, and made towards Rome it selfe, where
  <span class="rightnote">The Romans in despaire withdraw into the
  capitoll.</span> such feare and terror was striken into the heartes
  of the people, that all men were in despaire<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page455" id="page455">Page 455</a>]</span> to defend
  the citie: and therefore the senate with all the warlike youth of the
  citizens got them into the capitoll, which they furnished with
  victuals and all things necessarie for the maintenance of the same
  against a long siege. The honorable fathers and all the multitude of
  other people not apt for warres, remained still in the citie, as it
  were to perish with their countrie if hap so befell.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  The Galles enter into Rome.</span> In the meane time came the Galles
  to the citie, and entring by the gate Collina, they passed forth the
  right way vnto the market place, maruelling to sée the houses of the
  poorer sort to be shut against them, and those of the richer to
  remaine wide open; wherefore being doubtfull of some deceitfull
  traines, they were not ouer rash to enter the same; but <span class=
  "leftnote">The Reuerend aspect of the senators.</span> after they had
  espied the ancient fathers sit in their chaires apparelled in their

  shew of apparell.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><i>Marcus Papirius</i></span> In the meane
  time it chanced, that Marcus Papirius stroke one of the Galles on the
  head with his staffe, because he presumed to stroke his beard: with

  his sword, and therewith the slaughter being begun with one, all the
  residue of those ancient fatherlie men as they sat in their chaires
  were slaine and cruellie murthered. After this all the people found

  and their houses sacked. And thus was Rome taken by the two brethren,
  Beline and Brenne, 365 yeares after the first building thereof.
  Besides this, the Galles attempted in the night season to haue entred
  the capitoll: and in déed ordered their enterprise so secretlie, that
  they had atchieued their purpose, if a sort of <span class=

  noise disclosed them, in wakening the Romans that were asléepe: &amp;

  <h3>THE FOURTH CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>The Romans being thus put to their extreame shift, deuised among
  themselues how to reuoke Furius Camillus from exile, whom not long
  before they had vniustlie banished out of the citie. In the end they
  did not onelie send for him home, but also created him dictator,
  committing into his handes (so long as his office lasted) an absolute
  power ouer all men, both of life and death. Camillus forgetfull of
  the iniurie done to him, and mindfull of his dutie towards his
  countrie, and lamenting the state thereof, without delay gathered
  such an armie as the present time permitted.</p>

  <p>In the meane time those that kept the capitoll (being almost
  famished for lacke of vittels) <span class="rightnote">A
  composition.</span> compounded with Brenne and Beline, that for a
  thousand pounds weight in gold, the Romans should redéeme their
  liberties, and the said Brenne and Beline depart with their armie out
  of the citie and all the territories of Rome. But at the deliuerie of
  the monie, and by a certeine kind of hap, the Romans name was
  preserued at that time from such dishonor and ignominie as was
  likelie to haue insued. For some of the couetous sort of the Galles,
  not contented with the iust weight of the gold, did cast their swords
  also into the balance where the weights lay, thereby to haue ouer
  weight: wherevpon the Romans refused to make paiment after that
  weight.</p>

  <p>And thus whilest they were in altercation about this matter, the
  one importunnate to haue, <span class="rightnote">Camillus
  disappointeth the Galles of their paiment.</span> the other not
  willing to grant, the time passed, till in the meane season Camillus
  came in amongst them with his power, commanding that the gold should
  be had away, and affirming that without consent of the dictator, no
  composition or agréement might be concluded<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page456" id="page456">Page 456</a>]</span> by the
  meaner magistrate. He gaue a signe to the Galles to prepare
  themselues to battell, <span class="leftnote"><br />
  The Galles overthrowne</span> whervnto they lightlie agréed, and
  togither they went. The battell being once begun, the Galles that
  looked earst for gold, and not for battell, were easilie ouercome,
  such as stood to the brunt were slaine, and the rest by flight
  constreined to depart the citie.</p>

  <p>Polybius writeth, that the Galles were turned from the siege of
  the citie, through wars which chanced amongst their owne people at
  home, and therefore they concluded a peace with the Romans, and
  leauing them in libertie returned home againe.</p>

  <p>But howsoeuer the matter passed, thus much haue we stept from our
  purpose, to shew somwhat of that noble and most famous capteine
  Brennus, who (as not onelie our histories, but also Giouan Villani
  the Florentine dooth report) was a Britaine, and brother to Beline
  (as before is mentioned) although I know that manie other writers are
  not of that mind, affirming him to be a Gall, and likewise that after
  this present time of the taking of Rome by this Brennus 110 yeares,
  or there abouts, there was another Brennus a Gall by nation (say
  they) vnder whose conduct an other armie of the Gals inuaded Grecia,
  which Brennus had a brother that hight Belgius, although Humfrey
  Llhoyd and sir Iohn Prise doo flatlie denie the same, by reason of
  some discordance in writers, &amp; namelie in the computation of the
  yeares set downe by them that haue recorded the dooings of those
  times, whereof the error is growen. Howbeit I doubt not but that the
  truth of this matter shall be more fullie sifted out in time by the
  learned and studious of such antiquities. But now to our purpose.</p>

  <p>This is also to be noted, that where our histories make mention,
  that Beline was abroad with Brennus in the most part of his
  victories, both in Gallia, Germanie, and Italie; Titus <span class=
  "rightnote"><i>Titus Liu. Polydor.</i></span> Liuius speaketh but
  onlie of Brennus: wherevpon some write, that after the two brethren
  were by their mothers intreatance made friends, Brennus onlie went
  ouer to Gallia, and there through proofe of his woorthie prowesse,
  atteined to such estimation amongst the people called Galli Senones,
  that he was chosen to be their generall capteine at their going ouer
  <span class="leftnote"><i>Matth. West.</i></span> the mountaines into
  Italie. But whether Beline went ouer with his brother, and finallie
  returned backe againe, leauing Brennus behind him, as some write, or
  that he went not at all, but remained still at home whitest his
  brother was abroad, we can affirme no certeintie.</p>

  <p>Most part of all our writers make report of manie woorthie deeds
  accomplished by Beline, <span class="rightnote"><i>Polychr.
  <br />
  Gal. M.</i>
  <br />
  Caerleon Wiske built by Belline.</span> in repairing of cities
  decaied, &amp; erecting of other new buildings, to the adorning and
  beautifieng of his realme and kingdome. And amongst other works which
  were by him erected, he builded a citie in the south part of Wales,
  neare to the place where the riuer of Vske falleth into Seuerne, fast
  by Glamorgan, which citie hight Caerleon, or Caerlegion Ar Wiske.
  This Caerleon was the principall citie in time past of all Demetia,
  now called Southwales. Manie notable monuments are remaining there
  till this day, testifieng the great magnificence and roiall buildings
  of that citie in old time. In which citie also sith the time of
  Christ were thrée churches, one of saint Iulius the martyr, an other
  of saint Aron, and the third was the mother church of all Demetia,
  and the chiefe sée: but after, the same sée was translated vnto
  Meneuia, (that is to say) saint Dauid in Westwales. In this Caerleon
  was Amphibulus borne, who taught and instructed saint Albon.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span> This Beline also
  builded an hauen, with a gate ouer the same, within the citie of
  Troinouant now called London, in the summitie or highest part wherof
  afterwards was set a vessell of brasse, in the which were put the
  ashes of his bodie, which bodie after his deceasse was <span class=
  "leftnote"><br />
  <i>Iohn Leland.</i></span> burnt, as the maner of burieng in those
  daies did require. This gate was long after called Belins gate, and
  at length by corruption of language Billings gate. He builded also a
  castell eastward from this gate (as some haue written) which was long
  time after likewise called <span class="rightnote"><br />
  The Tower of London built by Beline.</span> Belins castell, and is
  the same which now we call the tower of London. Thus Beline studieng
  dailie to beautifie this land with goodlie buildings and famous
  workes, at length departed this life, after he had reigned with his
  brother iointlie and alone the space of 26 yeres.</p>

  <h3>THE FIFT CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p><span class="rightnote">GURGUINTUS</span> Gurguintus the sonne of
  Beline began to reigne ouer the Britains, in the yeare of the world
  1596, after the building of Rome 380, after the deliuerance of the
  Israelites out of captiuitie 164 complet, which was about the 33
  yeare of Artaxerxes Mnenon, surnamed Magnus, the seuenth king of the
  Persians. This Gurguint in the English chronicle is <span class=
  "leftnote"><i>Matth. West</i></span> named Corinbratus, and by
  Matthew Westmin. he is surnamed Barbiruc, the which bicause the
  tribute granted by Guilthdag king of Denmarke in perpetuitie vnto the
  kings of Britaine <span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Gal. M.</i> Gurguint c&#333;strained the Danes by force to pay
  their tribute.</span> was denied, he sailed with a mightie nauie and
  armie of men into Denmarke, where he made such warre with fire and
  sword, that the king of Denmarke with the assent of his barons was
  constreined to grant eftsoones to continue the paiment of the
  aforesaid tribute.</p>

  <p>After he had thus atchiued his desire in Denmarke, as he returned
  backe towards Britaine, he encountred with a nauie of 30 ships beside
  the Iles of Orkenies. These ships were fraught with men and women,
  and had to their capteine one called Bartholin or Partholin,
  <span class="rightnote"><i>Matth. West. Gal. Mon.</i></span>
  <br />
  who being brought to the presence of king Gurguint, declared that he
  with his people were banished out of Spaine, and were named Balenses
  or Baselenses, and had sailed long on the <span class=
  "leftnote">Basques.</span> sea, to the end to find some prince that
  would assigne them a place to inhabit, to whom <span class=
  "rightnote">Sée more hereof in Ireland.</span> they would become
  subiects, &amp; hold of him as of their souereigne gouernor.
  Therefore he besought the king to consider their estate, and of his
  great benignitie to appoint some void quarter where they might
  settle. The king with the aduice of his barons granted to them the
  Ile of Ireland, which as then (by report of some authors) lay waste
  and without habitation <span class="rightnote">Polychron.</span> But
  it should appeare by other writers, that it was inhabited long before
  those daies, by the people called Hibernenses, of Hiberus their
  capteine that brought them also out of Spaine.</p>

  <p>After that Gurguintus was returned into his countrie, he ordeined
  that the laws made by his ancestors should be dulie kept and
  obserued. And thus administring iustice to his subiects for the
  tearme of 19 yeares, he finallie departed this life, and was buried
  at London, <span class="leftnote">Caius.</span> or as some haue at
  Caerleon. In his daies was the towne of Cambridge with the
  vniuersitie first founded by Cantaber, brother to the aforesaid
  Bartholin (according to some writers) as after shall appeare.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">GUINTOLINUS.</span> Guintolinus or
  Guintellius the sonne of Gurguintus was admitted king of Britaine in
  the yere of the world 3614, after the building of the citie of Rome
  399, and second yere of the 206 Olimpiad. This Guintoline was a wise
  prince, graue in counsell, and sober in behauior. He had also a wife
  named Martia, a woman of perfect beautie, &amp; wisedome
  incomparable, as by hir prudent gouernement and equall administration
  of iustice after hir husbands deceasse, during hir sonnes minoritie,
  it most manifestlie appeared.</p>

  <p>It is thought that in an happie time this Guintoline came to the
  gouernement of this kingdome, being shaken and brought out of order
  with ciuill dissentions, to the end he might reduce it to the former
  estate, which he earnestlie accomplished: for hauing once got the
  place, he studied with great diligence to reforme anew, and to adorne
  with iustice, lawes and good orders, the British common wealth, by
  other kings not so framed as stood with the quietnesse thereof. But
  afore all things he vtterlie remooued and appeased such ciuill
  discord, as séemed yet to remaine after the maner of a remnant of
  those seditious factions and partakings, which had so long time
  reigned in this land. But as he was busie in hand herewith, death
  tooke him out of this life, after he had reigned 27 yeares, and then
  was he buried at London.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">SICILIUS.</span> <span class=

  sonne of Guintoline, being not past seuen yeares of age when his
  father died, was admitted king, in the yeare 3659, after the building
  of Rome 430, &amp; after the deliuerance of the Israelites out of
  captiuitie 218, &amp; in the sixt after the death of Alexander.
  <span class="rightnote">Queene Martia gouerneth in hir sonnes
  roome.</span> By reason that Sicilius was not of age sufficient of
  himselfe to guide the kingdoms of the Britains, his mother that
  worthie ladie called Martia, had the gouernance both of his realme
  and person committed to hir charge.</p>

  <p>She was a woman expert and skilfull in diuers sciences, but
  chiefelie being admitted to the gouernance of the realme, she studied
  to preserue the common wealth in good quiet <span class=

  therefore deuised and established profitable and conuenient lawes,
  the which after were called Martian lawes, of hir name that first
  made them. These lawes, as those that were thought good and
  necessarie for the preseruation of the common wealth, Alfred, or
  Alured, that was long after king of England, translated also out of
  the British toong, into the English Saxon speech, and then were they
  called after that translation <span class="leftnote"><br />
  <i>Matt. West.</i></span> Marchenelagh, that is to meane, the lawes
  of Martia. To conclude, this worthie woman guided the land during the

  perpetuall renowme and commendation. And when hir sonne came to
  lawfull age, she deliuered <span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Matt. Westm.</i></span> vp the gouernance into his handes. How
  long he reigned writers varie, some auouch but seuen yeares, though
  other affirme 15. which agréeth not so well with the accord of other
  histories and times. He was buried at London.</p>

  <h3>THE SIXT CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p><span class="rightnote">KIMARUS. <i>Fabian</i>.</span> Kimarus the
  sonne of Sicilius began to reigne ouer the Britaines, in the yeare of
  the world 3657, and after the building of Rome 442, &amp; in the
  first yeare of the 117. Olimpiad. This Kimarus being a wild yoong
  man, and giuen to follow his lusts and pleasures, was slaine by some
  that were his enimies, as he was abroad in hunting, when he had
  reigned scarselie three yeares.</p>

  the deliuerance of the Israelites 229, and in the fourth yeare of the
  Seleuciens, after which account the bookes of Machabees doo reckon,
  which began in the 14, after the death of Alexander. This Elanius in
  the English Chronicle is named also Haran; by Mat. Westm. Danius; and
  by an old chronicle which Fabian much followed, Elanius and Kimarus
  should seeme to be one person: but other hold the contrarie, and saie
  that he reigned fullie 8. yeares.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">MORINDUS.</span> Morindus the bastard

  Macedonia, which hauing dispatched Olimpias the mother of Alexander
  the great, and gotten Roxanes with Alexanders sonne into his hands,
  vsurped the kingdome of the Macedonians, and held it 15 yéeres. This
  Morindus in the English chronicle is called Morwith, and was a man of
  worthie fame in chiualrie and martiall dooings, but so cruell
  withall, that his vnmercifull nature could scarse be satisfied with
  the torments of them that had offended him, although oftentimes with
  his owne hands he cruellie put them to torture and execution. He was
  also beautifull and comelie of personage, liberall and bounteous, and
  of a maruellous strength.</p>

  and in battell putting<span class="page">[<a name="page459" id=

  <h3>THE SEUENTH CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>Gorbonianus the first son of Morindus succéeded his father in the
  kingdome of <span class="rightnote">GORBOMEN OR GORBONIANUS.</span>
  Britain, in the yéere of the world 3676, after the building of Rome
  461, and fourth yéere of the 121. Olimpiad. This Gorbonianus in the
  English chronicle is named Granbodian, and was a righteous prince in
  his gouernment, and verie deuout (according to such deuotion
  <span class="leftnote">A righteous and religious prince.</span> as he
  had) towards the aduancing of the religion of his gods: and thervpon
  he repaired all the old temples through his kingdome, and erected
  some new.</p>

  <p>He also builded the townes of Cambridge and Grantham (as Caxton
  writeth) and was beloued both of the rich and poore, for he honoured
  the rich, and relieued the poore in time of their necessities. In his
  time was more plentie of all things necessarie for the wealthfull
  state of man, than had béene before in anie of his predecessors
  daies. He died without issue, after he had reigned (by the accord of
  most writers) about the terme of ten yeares.</p>

  <p>Some write that this Gorbonian built the townes of Cairgrant, now
  called Cambridge, &amp; <span class="rightnote">Cambridge by whome it
  was built.</span> also Grantham, but some thinke that those which
  haue so written are deceiued, in mistaking the name; for that
  Cambridge was at the first called Granta: and by that meanes it might
  be that Gorbonian built onlie Grantham, and not Cambridge, namelie
  because other write how that Cambridge (as before is said) was built
  in the daies of Gurguntius the sonne of Beline, by one Cantaber a
  Spaniard, brother to Partholoin, which Partholoin by the aduice of
  the same Gurguntius, got seates for himselfe and his companie in
  Ireland (as before ye haue heard.)</p>

  <p>The said Cantaber also obteining licence of Gurguntius, builded a
  towne vpon the side of the riuer called Canta, which he closed with
  walles, and fortified with a strong tower or castell, and after
  procuring philosophers to come hither from Athens (where in his youth
  he had bene a student) he placed them there, and so euen then was
  that place furnished (as they saie) with learned men, and such as
  were readie to instruct others in knowledge of letters and
  philosophicall doctrine. But by whome or in what time soeuer it was
  built, certeine it is that there was a citie or towne walled in that
  place before the comming of the Saxons, called by the Britaines
  Caergrant, and by the Saxons Granchester.</p>

  <p>This towne fell so to ruine by the inuasion of the Saxons, that at
  length it was in maner left desolate, and at this day remaineth as a
  village. But néere therevnto vnder the Saxon<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page460" id="page460">Page 460</a>]</span> kings, an
  other towne was built, now called Cambridge, where by the fauour of
  king Sigebert and Felix a Burgundian, that was bishop of Dunwich, a
  schoole was erected, as in place conuenient shall appeare.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">ARCHIGALLUS.</span> Archigallus, the
  second sonne of Morindus, and brother vnto Gorbonianus, was admitted
  king of Britaine, in the yeare 3686, after the building of the citie
  of Rome 470, after the deliuerance of the Israelites out of
  captiuitie 255, and in the first yeare of Sosthenes king of
  Macedonia. This Archigallus (in the English chronicle called
  Artogaill) followed not the <span class="rightnote">He is giuen to
  nourish dissention.</span> steppes of his brother, but giuing
  himselfe to dissention and strife, imagined causes against his
  nobles, that he might displace them, and set such in their roomes as
  were men of base birth and of euill conditions. Also he sought by
  vnlawfull meanes to bereaue his wealthie subiects of their goods and
  riches, so to inrich himselfe and impouerish his people. For the
  which his inordinate dooings, his nobles conspired against him, and
  finallie depriued him of all his honor and kinglie dignitie, after he
  had reigned about the space of one yeare.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">ELIDURUS.</span> Elidurus the third sonne
  of Morindus, and brother to Archigallus, was by one consent of the
  Britains chosen to reigne ouer them in his brothers stead, after the
  creation of the world 3687, and after the building of the citie of
  Rome 471, after the deliuerance of the Israelites 256, &amp; in the
  first yeare of Sosthenes king of Macedonia. This Elidurus in the
  English chronicle named Hesider, or Esoder, prooued a most righteous
  prince, and doubting least he should doo otherwise than became him,
  if he did not take care for his brother Archigallus estate, a man
  might woonder what diligence he shewed in trauelling with the nobles
  of the realme to haue his brother restored to the crowne againe.</p>

  <p>Now as it chanced one day (being abroad on hunting in the wood
  called Calater) neare vnto Yorke, he found his brother Archigall
  wandering there in the thickest of that wildernesse, <span class=
  "rightnote">By this it should séeme that Acliud should not be in
  Scotland, contrarie to the Scotish authors.</span> whom in most
  louing maner he secretlie conueied home to his house, being as then
  the citie of Aldud, otherwise called Acliud. Shortlie after he feined
  himselfe sicke, and in all hast sent messengers about to assemble his
  barons, who being come at the day appointed, he called them one after
  another into his priuie chamber, and there handled them in such
  affectuous sort with wise and discréet words, that he got their good
  wils to further him to their powers, for the reducing of the kingdome
  eftsoones into the hands of his brother Archigallus.</p>

  <p>After this he assembled a councell at Yorke, where he so vsed the
  matter with the commons, that in conclusion, when the said Elidurus
  had gouerned the land well and honourablie the space of thrée yeares,
  he resigned wholie his crowne and kinglie title vnto his brother
  Archigallo, who was receiued of the Britaines againe as king by
  mediation of his <span class="rightnote">An example of brotherlie
  loue.</span> brother in manner as before is said. ¶ A rare example of
  brotherlie loue, if a man shall reuolue in his mind what an
  inordinate desire remaineth amongst mortall men to atteine to the
  supreme souereintie of ruling, and to kéepe the same when they haue
  it once in possession. He had well learned this lesson (as may
  appeare by his contentation and resignation) namelie, that</p>

  <p class="indent">Nec abnuendum si dat imperium Deus,
  <br />
  Nec appetendum,</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">Sen. in Thiess.</span> otherwise he would
  not haue béene led with such an equabilitie of mind. For this great
  good will and brotherlie loue by him shewed thus toward his brother,
  he was surnamed the godlie and vertuous.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">ARCHIGALLUS AGAIN.</span> When Archigallus
  was thas restored to the kingdome, and hauing learned by due
  correction that he must turne the leafe, and take out a new lesson,
  by changing his former trade of liuing into better, if he would
  reigne in suertie: he became a new man, vsing himselfe vprightlie in
  the administration of iustice, and behauing himselfe so woorthilie in
  all his doings, both toward the nobles &amp; commons of his realme,
  that he was both beloued and dread of all his subiects. And so
  continuing the whole tearme of his life, finallie departed out of
  this world, after he had reigned this second time the space of ten
  yeares, and<span class="page">[<a name="page461" id="page461">Page

  <h3>THE EIGHT CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>Here is to be noted, that euen from the beginning of the British
  kings, which reigned here in this land, there is great diuersitie
  amongest writers, both touching the names, and also the times of
  their reignes, speciallie till they come to the death of the last
  mentioned <span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span> king
  Elidurus. Insomuch that Polydor Virgil in his historie of England,
  finding a manifest error (as he taketh it) in those writers whome he
  followeth touching the account, from the comming of Brute, vnto the
  sacking of Rome by Brennus, whome our histories affirme to be the
  brother of Beline, that to fill vp the number which is wanting in the
  reckoning of the yeares of those kings which reigned after Brute,
  till the daies of the same Brenne &amp; Beline, he thought good to
  change the order, least one error should follow an other, and so of
  one error making manie, he hath placed those kings which after other
  writers should séeme to follow Brenne and Beline, betwixt Dunuallo
  and Mulmucius, father<span class="page">[<a name="page462" id=
  "page462">Page 462</a>]</span> to the said Beline and Brenne, and
  those fiue kings which stroue for the gouernement after the deceasse
  of the two brethren, Ferrex and Porrex, putting Guintoline to succéed
  after the fiue kings or rulers, and after Guintoline his wife Martia,
  during the minoritie of hir sonne, then hir said sonne named
  Sicilius.</p>

  <p>After him succéeded these whose names follow in order, Chimarius,
  Danius, Morindus, Gorbonianus, Archigallo, who being deposed,
  Elidurus was made king, and so continued till he restored the
  gouernement (as ye haue heard) to Archigallo againe, and after his
  death Elidurus was eftsoones admitted, and within awhile againe
  deposed by Vigenius and Peredurus, and after their deceasses the
  third time restored. Then after his deceasse followed successiuelie
  Veginus, Morganus, Ennanus, Idunallo, Rimo, Geruntius, Catellus,
  Coilus, Porrex the second of that name, Cherinus, Fulgentius,
  Eldalus, Androgeus, Vrianus and Eliud, after whom should follow
  Dunuallo Molmucius, as in his proper place, if the order of things
  doone, &amp; the course of time should be obserued, as Polydor
  gathereth by the account of yeares attributed to those kings that
  reigned before and after Dunuallo, according to those authours whom
  (as I said) he followeth, if they will that Brennus which led the
  Galles to Rome be the same that was sonne to the said Dunuallo
  Mulmucius, and brother to Beline.</p>

  <p>But sith other haue in better order brought out a perfect
  agréement in the account of yeares, and succession of those kings,
  which reigned and gouerned in this land before the sacking of Rome;
  and also another such as it is after the same, and before the Romans
  had anie perfect knowledge thereof; we haue thought good to follow
  them therein, leauing to euerie man his libertie to iudge as his
  knowledge shall serue him in a thing so doubtfull and vncerteine, by
  reason of variance amongst the ancient writers in that behalfe.</p>

  <p>And euen as there is great difference in writers since Gurguintus,
  till the death of Elidurus, so is there as great or rather greater
  after his deceasse, speciallie till king Lud <span class=
  "rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span> atteined the kingdóme. But as maie
  be gathered by that which Fabian and other whome he followeth doo
  write, there passed aboue 185 yeares betwixt the last yeare of
  Elidurus, and the beginning of king Lud his reigne, in the which time
  there reigned 32, or 33, kings, as some writers haue mentioned, whose
  names (as Gal. Mon. hath recorded) are these immediatlie héere named;
  Regnie the sonne of Gorbolian or Gorbonian, a worthie prince, who
  iustlie and mercifullie gouerned his people; Margan the sonne of
  Archigallo a noble prince likewise, and guiding his subiects in good
  quiet; Emerian brother to the same Margan, but far vnlike to him in
  maners, so that he was deposed in the sixt yeare of his reigne;
  Ydwallo sonne to Vigenius; Rimo the sonne of Peredurus; Geruntius the
  sonne of Elidurus; Catell that was buried at Winchester; Coill that
  was buried at Nottingham; Porrex a vertuous and most gentle prince;
  Cherinus a drunkard; Fulginius, Eldad, and Androgeus; these thrée
  were sonnes to Chercinus, and reigned successiuelie one after
  another; <span class="rightnote"><i>Vrianus</i>.</span> after them a
  sonne of Androgeus; then Eliud, Dedaicus, Clotinius, Gurguntius,
  Merianus, Bledius, Cop, Owen, Sicilius, Bledgabredus an excellent
  musician: after him his brother Archemall; then Eldol, Red, Rodiecke,
  Samuill, Penisell, Pir, Capoir; after him his sonne Gligweil an
  vpright dealing prince, and a good iusticiarie; whom succeeded his
  sonne Helie, which reigned 60 yeares, as the forsaid Gal. Mon.
  writeth, where other affirme that he reigned 40 yeares, and some
  againe say that he reigned but 7 moneths.</p>

  <p>There is great diuersitie in writers touching the reignes of these
  kings, and not onlie for the number of yéeres which they should
  continue in their reignes but also in their names: so that to shew
  the diuersitie of all the writers, were but to small purpose, sith
  the dooings of the same kings were not great by report made thereof
  by any approoued author. But this maie suffice to aduertise you, that
  by conferring the yéeres attributed to the other kings which reigned
  before them, since the comming of Brute, who should enter this land
  (as by the best writers is gathered) about the yéere before the
  building of Rome 367, which was in the yéere after the creation of
  the world 2850 (as is said) with their time, there remaineth 182
  yéeres to be dealt amongst these 33 kings, which reigned betwixt the
  said<span class="page">[<a name="page463" id="page463">Page
  463</a>]</span> Elidure &amp; Lud, which Lud also began his reigne
  after the building of the citie of Rome (as writers affirme) about
  679 yéeres, and in the yéere of the world 3895, as some that will
  séeme the precisest calculators doo gather.</p>

  <p>Polydor Virgil changing (as I haue shewed) the order of succession
  in the British kings, in bringing diuerse of those kings, which after
  other writers followed Beline and Brenne, to precéed them so
  successiuelie after Beline and Brenne, reherseth those that by his
  coniecture did by likelihood succéed, as thus. After the decesse of
  Beline, his sonne Gurguntius, being the second of that name,
  succeeded in gouernment of the land, and then these in order as they
  follow: Merianus, Bladanus, Capeus, Duinus, Sicilius, Bledgabredus,
  Archemallus, Eldorus, Rodianus, Redargius, Samulius, Penisellus,
  Pyrrhus, Caporus, Dinellus, and Helie, who had issue, Lud,

  this Ile is inuironed. But Humfrey Llhoyd holdeth, that it tooke name

  <p>After the decesse of the same Helie, his eldest son Lud began his

  the realme that were defectiue, abolishing euill customs and maners

  buildings to be made betwixt London stone (sic) and Ludgate, and
  builded for himselfe not farre from <span class="leftnote">The

  his said palace, which temple (as some take it) was after turned to a
  church, and at this daie called Paules. By reason that king Lud so
  much esteemed that citie before all other of his realme, inlarging it

  and Kent; and to Theomantius the countrie of Cornwall. Thus farre out
  of the British histories, whereby it maie be gathered, that the
  yéeres assigned to these kings that reigned before Cassibellane,

  <p><span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor</i>.</span> But whether these
  gouernors (whose names we haue recited) were kings, or rather rulers
  of the common wealth, or tyrants and vsurpers of the gouernment by
  force, it is vncerteine: for not one ancient writer of anie approued
  authoritie maketh anie remembrance of them: and by that which Iulius
  Cesar writeth, it maie and dooth appéere, that diuerse cities in his
  daies were gouerned of themselues, as héereafter it shall more
  plainlie appéere. Neither doth he make mention of those townes which
  the British historie affirmeth to be built by the same kings. In déed
  both he and other Latine writers speake of diuerse people that
  inhabited diuers portions of this land, as of the Brigantes,
  Trinobantes, Iceni, Silures, and such other like, but in what parts
  most of the said people did certeinlie inhabit, it is hard to auouch
  for certeine truth.</p>

  <p>But what Iohn Leland thinketh héereof, being one in our time that
  curiouslie searched out old antiquities, you shall after heare as
  occasion serueth: and likewise the opinions of other, <span class=

  Boetius, who coueting to haue all such valiant acts as were atchiued
  by the Britains to be ascribed to his countriemen the Scots, draweth
  both the Silures and Brigantes, with other of the Britains so farre
  northward, that he maketh them inhabitants of the Scotish countries.
  And what particular names soeuer they had, yet were they all Scots
  with him, and knowne by that generall name (as he would persuade vs
  to beléeue) saieng that they entred into Britaine out of Ireland 330
  yéeres before the incarnation of our Sauiour.</p>

  <p>Neuerthelesse, how generall soeuer the name of Scots then was,
  sure it is, that no speciall mention of them is made by anie writer,
  till about 300 yeares after the birth of our sauiour. And yet the
  Romans, which ruled this land, and had so much adoo with the people
  thereof, make mention of diuerse other people, nothing so famous as
  Boetius would make his Scotish men euen then to be. But to leaue to
  the Scots the antiquitie of their originall beginning, as they and
  other must doo vnto vs our descent from Brute and the other Troians,

  Iulius Cesar.</span><span class="page">[<a name="page465" id=
  "page465">465</a>]</span> In this season that Cassibellane had roiall
  gouernment héere in Britaine, Caius Iulius Cesar being appointed by
  the senat of Rome to conquer Gallia, was for that purpose created
  consull, and sent with a mightie army into the countrie, where after
  he had brought the <span class="leftnote"><br />
  <i>Cesar de bello Gal. lib 4.</i> Britains unknowne to the
  Romans.</span> Galles vnto some frame, he determined to assaie the
  winning of Britaine, which as yet the Romans knew not otherwise than
  by report. The chiefest cause that mooued him to take in hand that
  enterprise, was for that he did vnderstand, that there dailie came
  great succours out of that Ile to those Galles that were enimies vnto
  the Romans. And though the season <span class="rightnote"><br />

  purpose.</span> of that yéere to make warre was farre spent (for
  summer was almost at an end) yet he thought it would be to good
  purpose, if he might but passe ouer thither, and learne what maner of
  people did inhabit there, and discouer the places, hauens, and
  entries apperteining to that Ile.</p>

  <p>Héerevpon calling togither such merchants as he knew to haue had
  traffike thither with some trade of wares, he diligentlie inquired of
  them the state of the Ile: but he could not be throughlie satisfied
  in anie of those things that he coueted to know. Therefore thinking
  it good to vnderstand all things by view that might apperteine to the
  vse of that warre which he purposed to follow: before he attempted
  the same, he sent one <span class="rightnote"><br />

  a gallie or light pinesse to surueie the coasts of the Ile,
  commanding him (after diligent search made) to returne with spéed to
  him againe. He him selfe also drew downewards towards Bullenois, from
  whence the shortest cut lieth to passe ouer into Britaine.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Iohn Leland. Polydor.</i></span> In that part of Gallia there was
  in those daies an hauen called <i>Itius Portus</i> (which some take
  to be Calice) and so the word importeth, an harbourgh as then able to
  receiue a great number of ships. Vnto this hauen got Cesar all the
  ships he could out of the next borders &amp; parties, and those
  speciallie which he had prouided and put in a readinesse the last
  yeare for the warres (against them of Vannes in Armorica, now called
  Britaine in France) he caused to be brought thither, there to lie
  till they should heare further. In the meane time <span class=
  "rightnote">Vannes in Britane.</span> (his indeuour being knowne, and
  by merchants reported in Britaine) all such as were able to beare
  armour, were commanded and appointed to repaire to the sea side, that
  they might be readie to defend their countrie in time of so great
  danger of inuasion.</p>

  <p>¶ Cesar in his commentaries agréeth not with our historiographers:
  for he writeth that immediatlie vpon knowledge had that he would
  inuade Britaine, there came to him ambassadours from diuers cities of
  the Ile to offer themselues to be subiects to the Romans, and to
  deliuer hostages. Whome after he had exhorted to continue in their
  good mind, he sent <span class="rightnote">Comius.</span> home
  againe, and with them also one Comius gouernor of Artois, commanding
  him to repaire vnto as manie cities in Britaine as he might, and to
  exhort them to submit themselues to the Romans. He maketh no mention
  of Cassibellane, till the second iournie that he made into the Ile,
  at what time the said Cassibelane was chosen (as ye shall heare) to
  be the generall capteine of the Britains, and to haue the whole
  administration of the warre for defense of the countrie: but he
  nameth him not to be a king. Howbeit in the British historie
  <span class="rightnote">Which is more likelie in this behalfe, as
  appeared by the sequel.</span> it is contained, that Cesar required
  tribute of Cassibelane, and that he answered how he had not learned
  as yet to liue in seruage, but to defend the libertie of his
  countrie, and that with weapon in hand (if néede were) as he should
  well perceiue, if (blinded through couetousnesse) he should aduenture

  <p><span class="rightnote">Volusenus returneth.</span> Caius
  Volusenus within fiue daies after his departure from Cesar, returned
  vnto him with his gallie, and declared what he had séene touching the
  view which he had taken of <span class="leftnote">Cesar with two
  legions of souldiers passeth ouer into Britain.</span> the coasts of
  Britan. Cesar hauing got togither so manie saile as he thought
  sufficient for the transporting of two legions of souldiers, after he
  had ordered his businesse as he thought expedient, and gotten a
  conuenient wind for his purpose, did embarke himselfe and his people,
  and departed from Calice in the night about the third watch (which is
  about three or foure of the clocke after midnight) giuing order that
  the horssemen should take ship at an <span class="rightnote">The
  Britans readie to defend their countrie.</span> other place 8 miles
  aboue Calice, and follow him. Howbeit when they somewhat slacked the
  time, about ten of the clocke in the next day, hauing the wind at
  will, he touched on the coast of Britaine, where he might behold all
  the shore set and couered with men of warre. For the Britains hearing
  that Cesar ment verie shortlie to come against them, were assembled
  in armour to resist him: and now being aduertised of his approch to
  the land, they prepared themselues to withstand him.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  Cesar calleth a councell.</span> Cesar perceiuing this, determined to
  staie till the other ships were come, and so he lay at anchor till
  about 11 of the clocke, and then called a councell of the marshals
  and chiefe capteines, vnto whome he declared both what he had learned
  of Volusenus, and also further what he would haue doone, willing them
  that all things might be ordered as the reason of warre required. And
  because he perceiued that this place where he first cast anchor was
  not méete for the landing of his people, sith (from the heigth of the
  cliffes that closed on ech side the narrow créeke into the which he
  had thrust) the Britains might annoy his people with their bowes and
  dartes, before they could set foote on land, hauing now the wind and
  tide with him, he disanchored from thence, and drew alongst the coast
  vnder the downes, the <span class="rightnote">This was about
  day.</span> space of 7 or 8 miles, and there finding the shore more
  flat and plaine, he approched néere to the land, determining to come
  to the shore.</p>

  <p>The Britains perceiuing Cesars intent, with all spéed caused their
  horssemen and charets or wagons, which Cesar calleth <i>Esseda,</i>
  out of the which in those daies they vsed to fight, to march forth
  toward the place whither they saw Cesar drew, and after followed with
  their maine armie. Wherefore Cesar being thus preuented, inforced yet
  to land with his people, though he saw that he should haue much a
  doo. For as the Britains were in redinesse to resist him, so his
  great and huge ships could not come néere the shore, but were forced
  to <span class="rightnote">The Romans put to their shifts.</span>
  kéepe the déepe, so that the Romane soldiers were put to verie hard
  shift; to wit, both to leape forth of their ships, and being pestered
  with their heauie armour and weapons, to fight in the water with
  their enimies, who knowing the flats and shelues, stood either vpon
  the drie ground, or else but a little waie in the shallow places of
  the water; and being not otherwise encumbred either with armour or
  weapon, but so as they might bestir themselues at will, they laid
  load vpon the Romans with their arrowes and darts, and forced their
  horsses (being thereto inured) to enter the water the more easilie,
  so to annoy and distresse the Romans, who wanting experience in such
  kind of fight, were not well able to helpe themselues, nor to keepe
  order as they vsed to doo on land: wherfore they fought nothing so
  lustilie as they were woont to doo. Cesar perceiuing this, commanded
  the gallies to depart from the great ships, and to row hard to the
  shore, that being placed ouer against the open sides of the Britains,
  they might with their shot of arrows, darts, and slings, remoue the
  Britains, and cause them to withdraw further off from the water
  side.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  The Britans astonied.</span><span class="page">[<a name="page467" id=
  "page467">Page 467</a>]</span> This thing being put in execution
  (according to his commandement) the Britains were not a little
  astonied at the strange sight of those gallies, for that they were
  driuen with ores, which earst they had not séene, and shrewdlie were
  they galled also with the artillerie which the Romans discharged vpon
  them, so that they began to shrinke and retire somewhat backe.
  <span class="rightnote"><br />
  The valiant courage of an ensigne bearer.</span> Herewith one that
  bare the ensigne of the legion surnamed Decima, wherein the eagle was
  figured, as in that which was the chiefe ensigne of the legion, when
  he saw his fellowes nothing eager to make forward, first beséeching
  the gods that his enterprise might turne to the weale, profit, and
  honor of the legion, he spake with a lowd voice these words to his
  fellowes that were about him; "Leape forth now euen you woorthie
  souldiers (saith he) if you will not betraie your ensigne to the
  enimies: for surelie I will acquit my selfe according to my duetie
  both towards the common wealth, and my generall:" and therewith
  leaping forth into the water, he marched with his ensigne streight
  vpon the enimies. The Romans douting to lose their ensigne, which
  should haue turned them to great reproch, leapt out of their ships so
  fast as they might, and followed their standard, so that there ensued
  a sore re&ndash;encounter: and that which troubled the Romans most,
  was because they could not keepe their order, neither find anie sure
  footing, nor yet follow euerie man his owne ensigne, but to put
  themselues vnder that ensigne which he first met withall after their
  first comming forth of the ship.</p>

  <p>The Britains that were inured with the shelues and shallow places
  of the water, when they saw the Romans thus disorderlie come out of
  their ships, ran vpon them with their horsses, <span class=
  "rightnote">The fiercenesse of the Britains.</span> and fiercelie
  assailed them, and now and then a great multitude of the Britains
  would compasse in and inclose some one companie of them: and other
  also from the most open places of the shore bestowed great plentie of
  darts vpon the whole number of the Romans, and so troubled them verie
  sore.</p>

  <h3>THE TWELFT CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>Caesar perceiuing the maner of this fight, caused his men of warre

  follow the Britains farre, because they wanted their horssemen which
  were yet behind, &amp; through slacking of time could not come to

  fortune that was accustomed to follow Cesar in all his other
  enterprises.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  The Britans send to Cesar.</span> The Britains after this flight were
  no sooner got togither, but that with all speed they sent
  ambassadours vnto Cesar to treat with him of peace, offering to
  deliuer hostages, and further to stand vnto that order that Cesar
  should take with them in anie reasonable sort. With <span class=
  "leftnote">Comius of Arras.</span> these ambassadours came also
  Comius, whome Cesar (as you haue heard) had sent before into
  Britaine, whome notwithstanding that he was an ambassadour, and sent
  from Cesar with commission and instructions sufficientlie furnished,
  yet had they staied him as a prisoner. But now after the battell was
  ended, they set him at libertie, and sent him backe with their
  ambassadours, who excused the matter, laieng the blame on the people
  of the countrie; which had imprisoned him through lacke of
  vnderstanding what apperteined to the law of armes and nations in
  that behalfe.</p>

  <p>Cesar found great fault with their misdemenor, not onelie for
  imprisoning his ambassador,<span class="page">[<a name="page468" id=
  "page468">Page 468</a>]</span> but also for that contrarie to their
  promise made by such as they had sent to him into Gallia to deliuer
  hostages, in lieu thereof they had receiued him with warre: yet in
  the end he said <span class="rightnote"><br />
  Cesar demandeth hostages.</span> he would pardon them, and not séeke
  anie further reuenge of their follies. And herewith required of them
  hostages, of which, part were deliuered out of hand, and made promise
  that the residue should likewise be sent after, crauing some respit
  for performance of the same, bicause they were to be fetched farre
  off within the countrie.</p>

  <p>Peace being thus established after the fourth day of the Romans
  arriuall in Britaine, the 18 ships which (as ye haue heard) were
  appointed to conuey the horssemen ouer, loosed from the further hauen
  with a soft wind. Which when they approched so néere the shore of
  Britaine, that the Romans which were in Cesars campe might see them,
  suddenlie there arose so great a tempest, that none of them was able
  to kéepe his course, so that they were not onelie driuen in sunder
  (some being caried againe into Gallia, and some westward) but also
  the other ships that lay at anchor, and had brought ouer the armie,
  were so pitifullie beaten, tossed and shaken, that a great number of
  them did not onelie lose their tackle, but also were caried by force
  of wind into the high sea; the rest being likewise so filled with
  water, that they were in danger by sinking to perish and to be quite
  lost. For the moone in the same night was at the full, &amp;
  therefore caused a spring tide, which furthered the force of the
  tempest, to the greater perill of those ships and gallies that lay at
  anchor. There was no way for the Romans to helpe the matter:
  wherefore a great number of those ships were so bruised, rent and
  weather-beaten, that without new reparation they would serue to no
  vse of sailing. This was a great discomfort to the Romans that had
  brought ouer no prouision to liue by in the winter season, nor saw
  anie hope how they should repasse againe into Gallia.</p>

  <p>In the meane time the British princes that were in the Romane
  armie, perceiuing how greatlie this mishap had discouraged the
  Romans, and again by the small circuit of their campe, gessing that
  they could be no great number, and that lacke of vittels sore
  oppressed them, they stale priuilie away one after another out of the
  campe, purposing to assemble their powers againe, and to forestall
  the Romans from vittels, and so to driue the matter off till winter:
  which if they might doo (vanquishing these or closing them from
  returning) they trusted that none of the Romans from thencefoorth
  would attempt eftsoones to come into Britaine. Cesar mistrusting
  their dealings, because they staid to deliuer the residue of their
  hostages, commanded vittels to be brought out of the parties
  adioining, and not hauing other stuffe to repaire his ships, he
  caused 12 of those that were vtterlie past recouerie by the hurts
  receiued through violence of the tempest, to be broken, wherewith the
  other (in which some recouerie was perceiued) might be repaired and
  amended.</p>

  <h3>THE XIIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>Whilest these things were a dooing, it chanced that as one of the
  Romane legions named the seuenth, was sent to fetch in corne out of
  the countrie adioining (as their custome was) no warre at that time
  being suspected, or once looked for, when part of the people remained
  abroad in the field, and part repaired to the campe: those that
  warded before the campe, informed Cesar, that there appeared a dust
  greater than was accustomed from that quarter, into the which the
  legion was gone to fetch in corne. Cesar iudging therof what the
  matter might meane, commanded those bands that warded to go with him
  that way foorth, and appointed other two bands to come into their
  roomes, and the residue of his people to<span class="page">[<a name=
  "page469" id="page469">Page 469</a>]</span> get them to armor, and to
  follow quicklie after him.</p>

  <p>He was not gone anie great way from the campe, when he might sée
  where his people were ouermatched by the enimies, and had much a doo
  to beare out the brunt: for the legion being thronged together, the
  Britains pelted them sore with arrowes and darts on ech side: for
  sithens there was no forrage left in anie part of the countrie about,
  but onelie in this place, the Britains iudged that the Romans would
  come thither for it: therefore hauing lodged themselues within the
  woods in ambushes the night before; on the morrowe after when they
  saw the Romans dispersed here &amp; there, and busie to cut downe the
  corne, they set vpon them on a sudden, and sleaing some few of them,
  brought the residue out of order, compassing them about with their
  horssemen and charets, so that they were in great distresse.</p>

  <p>The maner of fight with these charets was such, that in the
  beginning of a battell they would ride about the sides and skirts of
  the enimies host, and bestow their darts as they sate in those
  charets, so that oftentimes with the braieng of the horsses, and
  craking noise of the charet whéeles they disordered their enimies,
  and after that they had woond themselues in amongst the troops of
  horssemen, they would leape out of the charets and fight on foot. In
  the meane time those that guided the charets would withdraw them
  selues out of the battell, placing themselues so, that if their
  people were ouermatched with the multitude of enimies, they might
  easilie withdraw to their charets, and mount vpon the same againe, by
  meanes wherof they were as readie to remooue as the horssemen, and as
  stedfast to stand in the battell as the footmen, and so to supplie
  both duties in one. And those charetmen by exercise and custome were
  so cunning in their feat, that although their horsses were put to run
  and gallop, yet could they stay them and hold them backe at their
  pleasures, and turne and wind them to and fro in a moment,
  notwithstanding that the place were verie stéepe and dangerous: and
  againe they would run vp and downe verie nimblie vpon the cops, and
  stand vpon the beame, and conuey themselues quicklie againe into the
  charet.</p>

  <p>Cesar thus finding his people in great distresse and readie to be
  destroied, came in good time, and deliuered them out of that danger:
  for the Britains vpon his approch with new succors, gaue ouer to
  assaile their enimies any further, &amp; the Romans were deliuered
  out of the feare wherein they stood before his comming. Furthermore,
  Cesar considering the time serued not to assaile his enimies, kept
  his ground, and shortlie after brought backe his legions into the
  campe.</p>

  <p>While these things were thus a dooing, &amp; all the Romans
  occupied, the rest that were abroad in the fields got them away.
  After this there followed a sore season of raine and fowle weather,
  which kept the Romans within their campe, and staid the Britains from
  offering battell. But in the meane time they sent messengers abroad
  into all parts of the countrie, to giue knowledge of the small number
  of the Romans, and what hope there was both of great spoile to be
  gotten, and occasion to deliuer themselues from further danger for
  euer, if they might once expell the Romans out of their campe.
  Herevpon a great multitude both of horssemen and footmen of the
  Britains were spéedilie got togither, and approched the Romane
  campe.</p>

  <p>Cesar although he saw that the same would come to passe which had
  chanced before, that if the enimies were put to the repulse, they
  would easilie escape the danger with swiftnesse of foot; yet hauing
  now with him thirtie horssemen (which Comius of Arras had brought
  ouer with him, when he was sent from Cesar as an ambassador vnto the
  Britains) he placed his legions in order of battell before his campe,
  and so comming to ioine with the Britains, they were not able to
  susteine the violent impression of the armed men, and so fled. The
  Romans pursued them so farre as they were able to ouertake anie of
  them, and so slaieng manie of them, &amp; burning vp all their houses
  all about, came backe againe to their campe. Immediatlie wherevpon,
  euen the same day, they sent ambassadors to Cesar to sue for peace,
  who gladlie accepting their offer, commanded them to send ouer into
  Gallia, after he should be returned thither, hostages in number duble
  to those that were agréed vpon at the first.</p>

  <p>After that these things were thus ordered, Cesar because the
  moneth of September was<span class="page">[<a name="page470" id=
  "page470">Page 470</a>]</span> well-neare halfe spent, and that
  winter hasted on (a season not méet for his weake and bruised ships
  to brooke the seas) determined not to staie anie longer, but hauing
  wind and weather for his purpose, got himselfe aboord with his
  people, and returned into Gallia.</p>

  Britaine. But the British historie (which Polydor calleth the new
  historie) declareth that Cesar in a pitcht field was vanquished at
  the first encounter, and so withdrew backe into France. Beda also
  writeth, that Cesar comming into the countrie of Gallia, where the
  people then called Morini inhabited (which are at this day the same
  that inhabit the diocesse of Terwine) from whence lieth the shortest
  passage ouer into Britaine, now called England, got togither 80 saile
  of great ships and row gallies, wherewith he passed ouer into
  Britaine, &amp; there at the first being wearied with sharpe and sore
  fight, and after taken with a grieuous tempest, he lost the greater
  part of his nauie, with no small number of his souldiers, and almost
  all his horssemen: and therwith being returned into Gallia, placed
  his souldiers in stéeds to soiourne there for the winter season. Thus
  saith Bede. The British historie moreouer maketh mention of thrée
  vnder-kings that aided Cassibellane in this first battell fought with
  Cesar, as Cridiorus alias Ederus, king of Albania, now called
  Scotland: Guitethus king of Venedocia, that is Northwales: and
  Britaell king of Demetia, at this day called Southwales.</p>

  <p>The same historie also maketh mention of one Belinus that was
  generall of Cassibellanes armie, and likewise of Nenius brother to
  Cassibellane, who in fight happened to get Cesars swoord fastened in
  his shield by a blow which Cesar stroke at him. Androgeus also and
  Tenancius were at the battell in aid of Cassibellane. But Nenius died
  within 15 daies after the battell of the hurt receiued at Cesars
  hand, although after he was so hurt, he slue Labienus one of the
  Romane tribunes: all which may well be true, sith Cesar either maketh
  the best of things for his owne honour, or else coueting to write but
  commentaries, maketh no account to declare the néedeles
  circumstances, or anie more of the matter, than the chiefe points of
  his dealing.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><i>Hector Boet.</i></span> Againe, the
  Scotish historiographers write, that when it was first knowne to the
  Britains, that Cesar would inuade them, there came from Cassibellane
  king of Britaine an ambassador vnto Ederus king of Scots, who in the
  name of king Cassibellane required aid against the common enimies the
  Romains, which request was granted, and 10 thousand Scots sent to the
  aid of Cassibellane. At their comming to London, they were most
  ioifullie receiued of Cassibellane, who at the same time had
  knowledge that the Romans were come on land, and had beaten such
  Britains backe as were appointed to resist their landing. Wherevpon
  Cassibellane with all his whole puissance mightilie augmented, not
  onlie with the succours of the Scots, but also of the Picts (which in
  that common cause had sent also of their people to aid the Britains)
  set forward towards the place where he vnderstood the enimies to
  be.</p>

  <p>At their first approch togither, Cassibellane sent foorth his
  horssemen and charets called <i>Esseda</i>, by the which he thought
  to disorder the araie of the enimies. Twice they incountred togither
  with doubtfull victorie. At length they ioined puissance against
  puissance, and fought a verie sore and cruell battell, till finally
  at the sudden comming of the Welshmen and Cornishmen, so huge a noise
  was raised by the sound of bels hanging at their trappers and
  charets, that the Romans astonied therewith, were more easilie put to
  flight. The Britains, Scots, and Picts following the chase without
  order or araie, so that by reason the Romans kept themselues close
  togither, the Britains, Scots, &amp; Picts did scarse so much harme
  to the enimies as they themselues receiued. But yet they followed on
  still vpon the Romans till it was darke night.</p>

  <p>Cesar after he had perceiued them once withdrawne, did what he
  could to assemble his companies togither, minding the next morning to
  séeke his reuenge of the former daies disaduantage. But forsomuch as
  knowledge was giuen him that his ships (by reason of a sore tempest)
  were so beaten and rent, that manie of them were past seruice, he
  doubted least such newes would incourage his enimies, and bring his
  people into despaire. Wherfore he determined not to fight till time
  more conuenient, sending all his wounded folks vnto the<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page471" id="page471">Page 471</a>]</span> ships,
  which he commanded to be newlie rigged and trimmed. After this,
  kéeping his armie for a time within the place where he was incamped
  without issuing foorth, he shortlie drew to the sea side, where his
  ships laie at anchor, and there within a strong place fortified for
  the purpose he lodged his host, and finallie without hope to atchieue
  anie other exploit auaileable for that time, he tooke the sea with
  such ships as were apt for sailing, and so repassed into Gallia,
  leauing behind him all the spoile and baggage for want of vessels and
  leisure to conueie it ouer. ¶ Thus haue the Scots in their chronicles
  framed the matter, more to the conformitie of the Romane histories,
  than according to the report of our British and English writers: and
  therefore we haue thought good to shew it héere, that the diuersitie
  of writers and their affections may the better appéere.</p>

  <p>Of this sudden departing also, or rather fléeing of Iulius Cesar
  out of Britaine, Lucanus the poet maketh mention, reciting the saieng
  of Pompeius in an oration made by him vnto his souldiers, wherin he
  reprochfullie and disdainfullie reprooued the dooings of Cesar in
  Britaine, saieng:</p>

  <h3>THE XIIIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>Now will we returne to the sequele of the matter, as Cesar
  himselfe reporteth. After his comming into Gallia, there were but two
  cities of all Britaine that sent ouer their <span class=
  "rightnote"><br />
  <i>Dion Cassius</i>.</span> hostages according to their couenant,
  which gaue occasion to Cesar to picke a new quarrell against them,
  which if it had wanted, he would yet (I doubt not) haue found some
  other: for his full meaning was to make a more full conquest of that
  Ile. Therefore purposing to passe againe thither, as he that had a
  great desire to bring the Britains vnder the obedience of the Romane
  estate, he caused a great number of ships to be prouided in the
  winter season and put in a readinesse, so that against the next
  spring there were found to be readie rigged six hundred ships, beside
  28 gallies. Héerevpon hauing taken order for the gouernance
  <span class="rightnote"><i>Cæsar de bello Gal. lib. 5.</i></span> of
  Gallia in his absence, about the beginning of the spring he came to
  the hauen of Calice, whither (according to order by him prescribed)
  all his ships were come, except 40 which by tempest were driuen
  backe, and could not as yet come to him.</p>

  <p>After he had staied at Calice (as well for a conuenient wind, as
  for other incidents) certeine daies, at length when the weather so
  changed that it serued his purpose, he tooke the sea, &amp; hauing
  with him fiue legions of souldiers, and about two thousand horssemen,
  he departed out of Calice hauen about sun setting with a soft
  southwest wind, directing his course forward: about midnight the wind
  fell, &amp; so by a calme he was carried alongst with the tide, so
  that in the morning when the day appéered, he might behold Britaine
  vpon his left hand. Then following the streame as the course of the
  tide changed, he forced with oares to fetch the shore vpon that part
  of the coast, which he had discouered, and tried the last yeere to be
  the best landing place for the armie. The diligence of the souldiers
  was shewed héere to be great, who with continuall toile droue foorth
  the heauie ships, to kéepe course with the gallies, &amp; so at
  length they landed in Britaine about noone on the next day, finding
  not one to resist his comming ashore: for as he learned by certeine
  prisoners which were taken after his comming to land, the Britains
  being assembled in purpose to haue resisted him, through feare
  striken into their harts, at the discouering of such an huge number
  of ships, they forsooke the shore and got them vnto the
  mountaines.<span class="page">[<a name="page472" id="page472">Page
  472</a>]</span> There were in deed of vessels one and other, what
  with vittellers, &amp; those which priuat men had prouided and
  furnished foorth for their owne vse, being ioined to the ordinarie
  number, at the least eight hundred saile, which appeering in sight
  all at one time, made a wonderfull muster, and right terrible in the
  eies of the Britains.</p>

  <p>But to procéed: Cesar being got to land, incamped his armie in a
  place conuenient: and after learning by the prisoners, into what part
  the enimies were withdrawne, he appointed one Quintus Atrius to
  remaine vpon the safegard of the nauie, with ten companies or cohorts
  of footmen, and thrée hundred horssemen: and anon after midnight
  marched foorth himselfe with the residue of his people toward the
  Britains, and hauing made 12 miles of way, he got sight of his
  enimies host, who sending downe their horssemen and charets vnto the
  riuer side, skirmished with the Romans, meaning to beate them backe
  from the higher ground: but being assailed of the Romane horssemen,
  they were repelled, &amp; tooke the woods for their refuge, wherein
  they had got a place verie strong, both by nature and helpe of hand,
  which (as was to be thought) had béene fortified before, in time of
  some ciuill warre amongst them: for all the entries were closed with
  trées which had béene cut downe for that purpose. Howbeit the
  souldiers of the 7 legion casting a trench before them, found meanes
  to put backe the Britains from their defenses, and so entring vpon
  them, droue them out of the woods. But Cesar would not suffer the
  Romans to follow the Britains, bicause the nature of the countrie was
  not knowne vnto them: and againe the day was farre spent, so that he
  would haue the residue thereof bestowed in fortifieng his campe.</p>

  <p>The next day, as he had sent foorth such as should haue pursued
  the Britains, word came to him from Quintus Atrius, that his nauie by
  rigour of a sore and hideous tempest was gréeuouslie molested, and
  throwne vpon the shore, so that the cabels and tackle being broken
  and destroied with force of the vnmercifull rage of wind, the
  maisters and mariners were not able to helpe the matter. Cesar
  calling backe those which he had sent foorth, returned to his ships,
  and finding them in such state as he had heard, tooke order for the
  repairing of those that were not vtterlie destroied, and caused them
  so to be drawne vp to the land, that with a trench he might so
  compasse in a plot of ground, that might serue both for defense of
  his ships, and also for the incamping of those men of warre, which he
  should leaue to attend vpon the safegard of the same. And bicause
  there were at the least a fortie ships lost by violence of this
  tempest, so as there was no hope of recouerie in them, he saw yet how
  the rest with great labour and cost might be repaired: wherefore he
  chose out wrights among the legions, sent for other into Gallia, and
  wrote ouer to such as he had left there in charge with the gouernment
  of the countrie, to prouide so manie ships as they could, and to send
  them ouer vnto him. He spent a ten daies about the repairing of his
  nauie, and in fortifieng the campe for defense thereof, which done,
  he left those within it that were appointed there before, and then
  returned towards his enimies.</p>

  <p>At his comming backe to the place where he had before incamped, he
  found them there readie to resist him, hauing their numbers hugelie
  increased: for the Britains hearing that he was returned with such a
  mightie number of ships assembled out of all parts of the land, and
  had by general consent appointed the whole rule and order of all
  things touching the warre vnto Cassiuellane or Cassibelane, whose
  dominion was diuided from the cities situat néere to the sea coast,
  by the riuer of Thames, 80 miles distant from the sea coast.
  <span class="rightnote">Cassibellane as should séeme, ruled in the
  parties of Oxfordshire, Barkshire, Buckinghamshire, and
  Bedfordshire.</span> This Cassibellane before time had bin at
  continuall warre with other rulers, and cities of the land: but now
  the Britains moued with the comming of the Romans, chose him to be
  chiefe gouernour of all their armie, permitting the order and rule of
  all things touching the defense of their countrie against the Romans
  onelie to him. Their horssemen and charets skirmished by the waie
  with the Romans, but so as they were put backe oftentimes into the
  woods and hills adioining: yet the Britains slue diuers of the Romans
  as they followed anie thing egerlie in the pursute.</p>

  <p>Also within a while after, as the Romans were busie in fortifieng
  their campe, the Britains<span class="page">[<a name="page473" id=
  "page473">Page 473</a>]</span> suddenlie issued out of the woods, and
  fierselie assailed these that warded before the campe, vnto whose aid
  Cesar sent two of the chiefest cohorts of two legions, the which
  being placed but a little distance one from another, when the Romans
  began to be discouraged with this kind of fight, the Britains
  therewith burst through their enimies, and came backe from thence in
  safetie. That daie Quintus Laberius Durus a tribune was slaine. At
  length Cesar sending sundrie other cohorts to the succour of his
  people that were in fight, and shrewdlie handled as it appéered, the
  Britains in the end were put backe. Neuerthelesse, that repulse was
  but at the pleasure of fortune; for they quited themselues afterwards
  like men, defending their territories with such munition as they had,
  vntill such time as either by policie or inequalitie of power they
  were vanquished; as you shall sée after in the course of the
  historie. Howbeit in fine they were ouer-run and vtterlie subdued,
  but not without much bloudshed and slaughter.</p>

  <h3>THE XV. CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>In all this maner of skirmishing and fight which chanced before
  the campe, euen in the sight and view of all men, it was perceiued
  that the Romans, by reason of their heauie <span class=
  "rightnote"><br />
  The Romans heauie armor.</span> armour (being not able either to
  follow the Britains as they retired, or so bold as to depart from
  their ensignes, except they would runne into danger of casting
  themselues awaie) were nothing méete to match with such kind of
  enimies: and as for their horssemen, they fought likewise in great
  hazard, bicause the Britains would oftentimes of purpose retire, and
  when they had trained the Romane horssemen a litle from their legions
  of footmen, they would leape out of their charrets and incounter with
  them on foot. And so the battell of horssemen was dangerous, and like
  in all points whether they pursued or retired.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  The manner of Britains in the warres.</span> This also was the maner
  of the Britains: they fought not close togither, but in sunder, and
  diuided into companies one separated from another by a good distance,
  and had their the troopes standing in places conuenient, to the which
  they might retire, and so reléeue one another with sending new fresh
  men to supplie the roomes of them that were hurt or wearie. The next
  day after they had thus fought before the campe of the Romans, they
  shewed themselues aloft on the hills, and began to skirmish with the
  Romane horssemen, but not so hotlie as they had doone the day before.
  But about noone, when Cesar had sent foorth thrée legions of footemen
  and all his horssemen vnder the leading of his lieutenant
  <span class="rightnote"><br />
  Caius Trebonius.</span> Caius Trebonius to fetch in forrage, they
  suddenlie brake out on euerie side, and vpon the forragers. The
  Romans so far foorth as they might, not breaking their arraie,
  <span class="leftnote"><br />
  <i>Dion Cassius</i> saith, that the Britains vanquished the Roman
  footmen at this time, but were put to the worst by the
  horssemen.</span> nor going from their ensignes or guidons, gaue the
  charge on them, and fiercelie repelled them, so that the horssemen
  hauing the legions of footemen at their backs, followed the Britains
  so long as they might haue the said legions in sight readie to
  succour them of néed were: by reason whereof, they slue a great
  number of the Britains, not giuing them leasure to recouer
  themselues, nor to staie that they might haue time to get out of
  their charrets. After this chase and discomfiture, all such as were
  come from other parties to the aid of their fellowes departed home,
  &amp; after that day the Britains aduentured to fight against Cesar
  with their maine power; and withdrawing beyond the riuer of *Thames,
  determined <span class="rightnote">*(which is to be supposed was at
  Kingston) or not far from thence.</span> to stop the enimies from
  passing the same, if by anie meanes they might: and whereas there was
  but one foord by the which they might come ouer, Cassibellane caused
  <span class="page">[<a name="page474" id="page474">Page
  474</a>]</span> the same to be set full of sharpe stakes, not onlie
  in the middest of the water, but also at the comming foorth on that
  side where he was lodged with his armie in good order, readie to
  defend the passage. Cesar learning by relation of prisoners which he
  tooke, what the Britains intended to doo, marched foorth to the riuer
  side, where the foord was, by the which his armie might passe the
  same on foot though verie hardlie. At his comming thither, he might
  perceiue how the Britains were readie on the further side to impeach
  his passage, and how that the banke at the comming foorth of the
  water was pight full of sharpe stakes, and so likewise was the
  chanell of the riuer set with piles which were couered with the
  water.</p>

  <p>These things yet staied not Cesar, who appointing his horssemen to
  passe on before, commanded the footemen to follow. The souldiers
  entring the water, waded through with such spéed and violence
  (nothing appéering of them aboue water but their heads) that the
  Britains were constreined to giue place, being not able to susteine
  the brunt of the Romane horssemen, and the legions of their footemen,
  and so abandoning the place betooke them to flight. Cassibellane not
  minding to trie the matter anie more by battell, sent awaie the most
  part of his people, but yet kept with him about a foure thousand
  charretmen or wagoners, and still watched what waie the Romans tooke,
  coasting them euer as they marched, and kept somewhat aside within
  the couert of woods, and other combersome places. And out of those
  quarters through which he vnderstood the Romans wold passe, he
  gathered both men and cattell into the woods &amp; thicke forrests,
  leauing nothing of value abroad in the champion countrie. And when
  the Roman horssemen did come abroad into the countrie to séeke
  booties, he sent out his charrets vnto the knowne waies and passages
  to skirmish with the same horssemen, so much to the disaduantage of
  the Romans, that they durst not straie farre from their maine armie.
  Neither would Cesar permit them (least they might haue béene vtterlie
  distressed by the Britains) to depart further than the maine battels
  of the footemen kept pace with them, by reason whereof the countrie
  was not indamaged by fire and spoile, but onlie where the armie
  marched.</p>

  <p><span class="leftnote">Troinouants where they inhabited.</span> In
  the meane time, the Troinouants which some take to be Middlesex &amp;
  Essex men, whose citie was the best fensed of all those parties, and
  thought to be the same that now is called London, sent ambassadours
  vnto Cesar, offering to submit themselues vnto him, and to obeie his
  ordinances, and further besought him to defend Mandubratius from the
  iniuries of K. Cassibellane, which Mandubratius had fled vnto Cesar
  into France, after <span class="rightnote">Imanuentius.</span> that
  Cassibellane had slaine his father named Imanuentius, that was chiefe
  lord and king of the Troinouants, and so now by their ambassadors the
  same Troinouants requested Cesar, not onelie to receiue Mandubratius
  into his protection, but also to send him vnto them, that he might
  take the gouernment and rule of their citie into his hands. Cesar
  commanded them to deliuer vnto him 40 hostages, and graine for his
  armie, and therewith <span class="rightnote"><br />
  Some take the Troinouants to be Londoners.</span> sent Mandubratius
  vnto them. The Troinouants accomplished his commandements with all
  spéed, sending both the appointed number of hostages, and also graine
  for the armie. And being thus defended and preserued from iniurie of
  the souldiers, the people called Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites,
  Bibroci, and Cassi, submitted themselues vnto Cesar, by whom he
  vnderstood that the towne of Cassibellane was not far from the place
  where he was then incamped fensed with wooddes and marishes, into the
  which a great number of people with their cattell and other substance
  was withdrawne. The Britains in those daies (as Cesar writeth) called
  that a towne or hold, which they had fortified with anie thicke
  combersome wood, with trench and rampire, into the which they vsed to
  get themselues for the auoiding of inuasion.</p>

  <p>Cesar with his legions of souldiers therfore marched thither, and
  finding the place verie strong both by nature and helpe of hand,
  assaulted it on two partes. The Britains defending their strength a
  while, at length not able longer to endure the impression of the
  Romans, fled out on the contrarie side of the towne where the enimies
  were not. Within this place a great number of cattell was found, and
  manie of the Romans taken by the Britains that<span class=

  <h3>THE XVJ. CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>Now whilest these thinges passed on this sort in those parts,
  Cassibellane sent messengers <span class="rightnote">Foure kings in
  Kent</span> into Kent vnto foure kings (which ruled that side of the
  land in those daies) Cingetorix, Caruilius, Taximagulus, and Segonax,
  commanding them, that assembling togither their whole puissance, they
  should assaile the campe of the Romans by the sea side where certeine
  bands lay (as ye haue heard) for safegard of the nauie. They
  according to his appointment came suddenlie thither, and by the
  Romans that sailed forth vpon them were sharplie fought with, and
  lost diuers of their men that were slaine and taken, and amongst the
  prisoners that the Romans tooke, Cingetorix was one. When
  Cassibellane heard these newes, being sore troubled for these losses
  thus chancing one in the necke of an other, but namelie most
  discouraged, for that diuers cities had yéelded vnto the Romans: he
  sent ambassadours by means of Romius of Arras vnto Cesar, offering to
  submit himselfe.</p>

  <p>Cesar meaning to winter in Gallia, and therefore because summer
  drew towards an end, willing to dispatch in Britaine, commanded that
  hostages should be deliuered, and appointed what tribute the Britains
  should yéerelie send vnto the Romans. He also forbad and commanded
  Cassibellane, that he should not in anie wise trouble or indamage
  Madubratius or the Londoners. After this, when he had receiued the
  hostages, he brought his armie to the sea, and there found his ships
  well repaired, decked, and in good point: therefore he commanded that
  they should be had downe to the sea. And because he had a great
  number of prisoners, and diuers of his ships were lost in the
  tempest, he appointed to transport his armie ouer into Gallia at two
  conueies, which was doone with good successe about the middest of
  September, though the ships returning for the residue of the armie,
  after the first conueie, were driuen so with force of weather, that a
  great number of them could not come to land at the place appointed:
  so that Cesar was constreined to fraught those that he could get with
  a greater burden, and so departed from the coast of Britaine, and
  safelie landed with the remnant of his people in Gallia with as good
  spéed as he could haue desired. <span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Dion Cassius</i>.</span> He thought not good to leaue anie of his
  people behind him, knowing that if he should so doo, they were in
  danger to be cast awaie. And so because he could not well remaine
  there all the winter season for doubt of rebellion in Gallia, he was
  contented to take vp, and returne thither, sith he had doone
  sufficientlie for the time, least in coueting the more, he might haue
  come in perill to lose that which he had alreadie obteined.</p>

  <br />
  Matt. West.</i></span> our histores farre differ from this, affirming
  that Cesar comming the second time, was by the Britains with
  valiancie and martiall prowesse beaten and repelled, as he was at the
  first, and speciallie by meanes that Cassibellane had pight in the
  Thames great piles of trées piked with yron, through which his ships
  being entred the riuer, were perished and lost.<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page476" id="page476">Page 476</a>]</span> And after
  his comming a land, he was vanquished in battell, and constrained to
  flee into Gallia with those ships that remained. For ioy of this
  second victorie (saith Galfrid) Cassibellane made a great feast at
  London, and there did sacrifice to the gods.</p>

  <p>At this feast there fell variance betwixt two yoong gentlemen, the
  one named Hirilda, nephew to Cassibellane, and the other Euelie or
  Eweline, being of aliance to Androgeus earle of London. They fell at
  discord about wrestling, and after multiplieng of words, they came to
  dealing of blowes, by meanes whereof parts were taken, so that there
  ensued a sore fraie, in the which diuerse were wounded and hurt, and
  amongst other Hirilda the kings nephew was slaine by the hands of
  Eweline. The king sore displeased herewith, meant to punish Eweline
  according to the order of his lawes, so that he was summoned to
  appeare in due forme to make answer to the murder: but Eweline by the
  comfort of Androgeus disobeied the summons, &amp; departed the court
  with Androgeus, in contempt of the king and his lawes. The king to be
  reuenged vpon Androgeus, gathered a power, and began to make warre
  vpon him.</p>

  <p>Androgeus perceiuing himselfe not able to withstand the kings
  puissance, sent letters to Iulius Cesar, exhorting him to returne
  into Britaine, and declaring the whole matter concerning the variance
  betwixt him and the king, promising to aid the Romans in all that he
  might. Iulius Cesar ioifull of this message, prepared his nauie, and
  with all spéed with a mightie host imbarked in the same, came toward
  Britaine: but yer he would land, doubting some treason in Androgeus,
  he receiued from him in hostage his sonne named Scena, and thirtie
  other of the best and most noble personages of all his dominion.
  After this he landed, and ioining with Androgeus, came into a vallie
  néere to Canturburie, and there incamped. Shortlie after came
  Cassibellane with all his power of Britains, and gaue battell to the
  Romans. But after the Britains had long fought and knightlie borne
  themselues in that battell, Androgeus came with his people on a wing,
  and so sharplie assailed them, that the Britains were constrained to
  forsake the field, and tooke themselues to flight. The which flight
  so discomforted them, that finallie they all fled, and gaue place to
  the Romans, the which pursued and slue them without mercie, so that
  Cassibellane with the residue of his people withdrew to a place of
  suertie, but being enuironed about with the puissance of the Romans,
  and of Androgeus, who had with him seuen thousand men there in the
  aid of the Romans, <span class="rightnote"><br />
  So saith <i>Campion</i>, but <i>Galfrid Monu</i>. saith fiue
  thousand.</span> Cassibellane in the end was forced to fall to a
  composition, in couenanting to paie a yearelie tribute of thrée
  thousand pounds. When Cesar had ordered his businesse as he thought
  conuenient, he returned and with him went Androgeus, fearing the
  displeasure of Cassibellane.</p>

  <p>The reuerend father Bede writing of this matter, saith thus: After
  that Cesar being returned into Gallia, had placed his souldiors
  abroad in the countrie to soiorne for the winter season, he caused
  ships to be made readie, to the number of 600, with the which
  repassing into Britaine, whilest he marched foorth with a mightie
  armie against the enimies, his ships that lay at anchor being taken
  with a sore tempest, were either beaten one against another, or else
  cast vpon the flats and sands, and so broken; so that fortie of them
  were vtterlie perished, and the residue with great difficultie were
  repaired. The horssemen of the Romans at the first encounter were put
  to the worsse, and Labienus the tribune slaine. In the second
  conflict he vanquished the Britains, not without great danger of his
  people. After this, he marched to the riuer of Thames, which as then
  was passable by foord onelie in one place and not else, as the report
  goeth. On the further banke of that riuer, Cassibellane was incamped
  with an huge multitude of enimies, and had pitcht and set the banke,
  <span class="rightnote">The stakes remained to be séene in Bedes
  daies.</span> and almost all the foord vnder the water full of sharpe
  stakes, the tokens of which vnto this day are to be séene, and it
  séemeth to the beholders that euerie of these stakes are as big as a
  mans thigh, sticking fast in the bottome of the riuer closed with
  lead. This being perceiued of the Romans, and auoided, the Britains
  not able to susteine the violent impression of the Roman legions, hid
  themselues in the woods, out of the which by often issues, they
  gréeuouslie and manie times assailed the Romans, and did them great
  damage. In the meane time the strong citie of Troinouant with hir
  duke Androgeus deliuering fortie<span class="page">[<a name="page477"
  id="page477">Page 477</a>]</span> hostages, yéelded vnto Cesar, whose
  example manie other cities following, allied themselues with the
  Romans, by whose information Cesar with sore fight tooke at length
  the towne of Cassibellane, situat betwixt two marches, fensed also
  with the couert of woods, &amp; hauing within it great plentie of all
  things. After this Cesar returned into France, and bestowed his armie
  in places to soiorne there for the winter season.</p>

  <p>The Scotish writers report, that the Britains, after the Romans
  were the first time repelled (as before ye haue heard) refused to
  receiue the aid of the Scotish men the second time, and so were
  vanquished, as in the Scotish historie ye may sée more at length
  expressed. Thus much touching the war which Iulius Cesar made against
  the Britains, in bringing them vnder tribute to the Romans. But this
  tributarie subiection was hardlie mainteined for a season.</p>

  <p>¶ Now here is to be noted, that Cesar did not vanquish all the
  Britains: for he came not amongst the northerne men, onlie
  discouering and subduing that part which lieth towards the French
  seas: so that sith other of the Roman emperors did most earnestlie
  trauell <span class="rightnote"><i>Cornelius Tacitus.
  <br />

  their subiection (which were euer redie to rebell so manie sundrie
  times) Cesar might séeme rather to haue shewed Britaine to the
  Romans, than to haue deliuered the possession of the same. This
  subiection, to the which he brought this Ile (what maner of one
  soeuer it was) chanced about the yeare of the world 3913, after the
  building of Rome 698, before the birth of our sauior 53, the first
  and second yeare of the 181 Olympiad, after the comming of Brute
  1060, before the conquest made by William duke of Normandie 1120, and
  1638 yeres before this present yere of our Lord 1585, after Harisons

  <h3>THE XVIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p>After that Iulius Cesar had thus made the Britains tributaries to
  the Romans, and was returned into Gallia, Cassibellane reigned 7
  yeares, and was vanquished in the ninth or tenth yeare after he began
  first to reigne so that he reigned in the whole about 15 or as some
  haue 17 yeares, and then died, leauing no issue behind him. There
  hath bin an old chronicle <span class=
  "rightnote"><i>Fabian</i>.</span> (as Fabian recordeth) which he saw
  and followeth much in his booke, wherein is conteined, that this
  Cassibellane was not brother to Lud, but eldest sonne to him: for
  otherwise as may be thought (saith he) Cesar hauing the vpper hand,
  would haue displaced him from the gouernement, and set vp Androgeus
  the right heire to the crowne, as sonne to the said Lud. But
  whatsoeuer our chronicles or the British histories report of this
  matter, it should appere by that which Cesar writeth (as partlie ye
  haue heard) that Britaine in those daies was <span class=
  "leftnote"><i>Cæsar</i>.</span> not gouerned by one sole prince, but
  by diuers, and that diuers cities were estates of themselues, so that
  the land was diuided into sundrie gouernements, much after the forme
  and maner as Germanie and Italie are in our time, where some cities
  are gouerned by one onelie prince, some by the nobilitie, and some by
  the people. And whereas diuers of the rulers in those daies here in
  this land were called kings, those had more large seigniories than
  the <span class="rightnote">Cassibellane a King.</span> other, as
  Cassibellane, who was therefore called a king.</p>

  <p>And though we doo admit this to be true, yet may it be, that in
  the beginning, after Brute entered the land, there was ordeined by
  him a monarchie, as before is mentioned, which might continue in his
  posteritie manie yeares after, and yet at length before the comming
  of Cesar, through ciuil dissention, might happilie be broken, and
  diuided into parts,<span class="page">[<a name="page478" id=
  "page478">Page 478</a>]</span> and so remained not onelie in the time
  of this Cassibellane, but also long after, whilest they liued as
  tributaries to the Romans, till finallie they were subdued by the
  Saxons. In which meane time, through the discord, negligence, or
  rather vnaduised rashnes of writers, hard it is to iudge what may be
  affirmed and receiued in their writings for a truth; namelie,
  concerning the succession of the kings that are said to haue reigned
  betwixt the daies of Cassibellane, <span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Cor. Tacit.
  <br />
  in uita. lib. Agr.</i></span> and the comming of the Saxons. The
  Roman writers (and namelie Tacitus) report, that the Britains in
  times past were vnder the rule of kings, and after being made
  tributaries, were drawne so by princes into sundrie factions, that to
  defend and kéepe off a common ieopardie, scarselie would two or thrée
  cities agrée togither, and take weapon in hand with one accord, so
  that while they fought by parts, the whole was ouercome. And after
  this sort they say that Britaine was brought into the forme of a
  prouince by the Romans, from whom gouernors vnder the name of legats
  and procurators were sent that had the rule of it.</p>

  <p>But yet the same authors make mention of certeine kings (as
  hereafter shall appeare) who while the Romane emperors had the most
  part of the earth in subiection, reigned in Britaine. <span class=
  "leftnote"><i>Gildas in epist.</i></span> The same witnesseth Gildas,
  saieng: Britaine hath kings, but they are tyrants: iudges it hath,
  but the same are wicked, oftentimes spoiling and tormenting the
  innocent people. And Cesar (as ye haue heard) speaketh of foure kings
  that ruled in Kent, and thereabouts. <span class="rightnote">Some
  take Prasutagus and Aruiragus to be one man.</span> Cornelius Tacitus
  maketh mention of Prasutagus, and Cogidunus, that were kings in
  Britaine: and Iuuenal speaketh of Aruiragus: and all the late
  writers, of Lucius. Hereby it appeareth, that whether one or mo, yet
  kings there were in Britain, bearing rule vnder the Romane
  emperors.</p>

  <p><span class="leftnote"><br />
  <i>Gal. Mon.</i></span> On the other part, the common opinion of our
  chronicle-writers is, that the chiefe gouernment remained euer with
  the Britains, &amp; that the Romane senat receiuing a yearelie
  tribute, sent at certeine times (<i>Ex officio</i>) their emperors
  and lieutenants into this Ile, to represse the rebellious tumults
  therein begun, or to beat backe the inuasion of the enimies that went
  about to inuade it. And thus would these writers inferre, that the
  Britains euer obeied their king, till at length they were put beside
  the gouernement by the Saxons. But whereas in the common historie of
  England, the succession of kings ought to be kept, so oft as it
  chanceth in the same that there is not anie to fill the place, then
  one while the Romane emperors are placed in their steads, and another
  while their lieutenants, and are said to be created kings of the
  Britains, as though the emperors were inferiors vnto the kings of
  Britaine, and that the Romane lieutenants at their appointments, and
  not by prescript of the senat or emperours, administred the
  prouince.</p>

  <p>This may suffice here to aduertise you of the contrarietie in
  writers. Now we will go foorth in following our historie, as we haue
  doone heretofore, sauing that where the Romane histories write of
  things done here by emperors, or their lieutenants, it shall be
  shewed as reason requireth, sith there is a great appearance of truth
  oftentimes in the same, as those that be authorised and allowed in
  the opinion of the learned.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote">THEOM&#256;DEUS</span> AFTER the death of

  made king of Britaine in the yéere of the world 3921, after the

  in the same chronicle it is conteined, that not he, but his brother
  Androgeus <span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Gal. Mon.</i></span> was king, where Geffrey of Monmouth &amp;
  others testifie, that Androgeus abandoned the land clerelie, &amp;
  continued still at Rome, because he knew the Britains hated him for
  treason he had committed in aiding Iulius Cesar against Cassibellane.
  Theomantius ruled the land in good quiet, and paid the tribute to the
  Romans which Cassibellane had granted, and finallie departed this
  life after he had reigned 22 yeares, and was buried at London.</p>

  <p><span class="leftnote">KYMBELINE</span> Kymbeline or Cimbeline the
  sonne of Theomantius was of the Britains made king after the deceasse
  of his father, in the yeare of the world 3944, after the building of
  Rome 728, <span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian</i> out of <i>Guido de
  Columna.</i></span> and before the birth of our Sauiour 33. This man
  (as some write) was brought vp at Rome, and there made knight by
  Augustus Cesar, vnder whome he serued in the warres, and was in such
  fauour with him, that he was at libertie to pay his tribute or not.
  Little other mention is made of his dooings, except that during his
  reigne, the Sauiour of the <span class="leftnote">Christ our saviour
  borne.</span> world our Lord Iesus Christ the onelie sonne of God was
  borne of a virgine, about the 23 yeare of the reigne of this
  Kymbeline, &amp; in the 42 yeare of the emperour Octauius Augustus,
  <span class="rightnote">3966.</span> that is to wit, in the yeare of
  the world 3966, in the second yeare of the 194 Olympiad, after the
  building of the citie of Rome 750 nigh at an end, after the
  vniuersall floud 2311, from the birth of Abraham 2019, after the
  departure of the Israelits out of Egypt 1513, after the captiuitie of
  Babylon 535, from the building of the temple by Salomon 1034, &amp;
  from the arriuall of Brute 1116, complet. Touching the continuance of
  the yeares of Kymbelines reigne, some writers doo varie, but the best
  approoued affirme, that he reigned 35 years and then died, &amp; was
  buried at London, leauing behind him two sonnes, Guiderius and
  Aruiragus.</p>

  <p>¶ But here is to be noted, that although our histories doo
  affirme, that as well this Kymbeline, as also his father Theomantius
  liued in quiet with the Romans, and continuallie to them paied the
  tributes which the Britains had couenanted with Iulius Cesar to pay,
  yet we find in the Romane writers, that after Iulius Cesars death,
  when Augustus had taken vpon <span class="leftnote"><br />
  <i>Cor. Tacitus.
  <br />
  in uita lu. Agr.
  <br />
  Dion Cassius</i>.</span> him the rule of the empire, the Britains
  refused to paie that tribute: whereat as Cornelius Tacitus reporteth,
  Augustus (being otherwise occupied) was contented to winke; howbeit,
  through earnest calling vpon to recouer his right by such as were
  desirous to sée the vttermost of the British kingdome; at length, to
  wit, in the tenth yeare after the death of Iulius Cesar, which was
  about the thirtéenth yeare of the said Theomantius, Augustus made
  prouision to <span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Dion Cassius.</i></span> passe with an armie ouer into Britaine,
  &amp; was come forward vpon his iournie into Gallia Celtica: or as we
  maie saie, into these hither parts of France.</p>

  <p>But here receiuing aduertisements that the Pannonians, which
  inhabited the countrie now called Hungarie, and the Dalmatians whome
  now we call Slauons had rebelled, he thought it best first to subdue
  those rebells neere home, rather than to séeke new countries, and
  leaue such in hazard whereof he had present possession, and so
  turning his power against the Pannonians and Dalmatians, he left off
  for a time the warres of Britaine, whereby the land remained without
  feare of anie inuasion to be made by the Romans, till the yeare after
  the building of the citie of Rome 725, and about the 19 yeare of king
  Theomantius reigne, that Augustus with an armie departed once againe
  from Rome to passe ouer into Britaine, there to make warre. But after
  his comming into Gallia, when the Britains sent to him certeine
  ambassadours to treat with him of peace, he staied there to settle
  the state of things among the Galles, for that they were not in verie
  good order. And hauing finished there, he went into Spaine, and so
  his iournie into Britaine was put off till the next yeare, that is,
  the 726 after the building of Rome, which fell before the birth of
  our sauiour 25, about which time Augustus eftsoons meant the third
  time to haue made a voiage into Britaine, because they could not
  agrée vpon couenants. But as the Pannonians and Dalmatians had
  aforetime staied <span class="rightnote">He kept not promise with the
  Romans. Those of Calice and Biskaie.</span> him, when (as before is
  said) he meant to haue gone against the Britans: so euen now the
  Salassians (a people inhabiting about Italie and Switserland) the
  Cantabrians and Asturians by such rebellious sturrs as they raised,
  withdrew him from his purposed iournie. But<span class=
  "page">[<a name="page480" id="page480">Page 480</a>]</span> whether
  this controuersie which appeareth to fall forth betwixt the Britains
  and Augustus, was occasioned by Kymbeline, or some other prince of
  the Britains, I haue not to auouch: for that by our writers it is
  reported, that Kymbeline being brought vp in Rome, &amp; knighted in
  the court of Augustus, euer shewed himselfe a friend to the Romans,
  &amp; chieflie was loth to breake with them, because the youth of the
  Britaine nation should not be depriued of the benefit to be trained
  and brought vp among the Romans, whereby they might learne both to
  behaue themselues like ciuill men, and to atteine to the knowledge of
  feats of warre.</p>

  <p>But whether for this respect, or for that it pleased the almightie
  God so to dispose the minds of men at that present, not onlie the
  Britains, but in manner all other nations were contented to be
  obedient to the Romane empire. That this was true in the Britains, it
  is <span class="leftnote"><i>Strab. Geog.</i></span> euident enough
  by Strabos words, which are in effect as followeth. "At this present
  (saith he) certeine princes of Britaine, procuring by ambassadors and
  dutifull demeanors the amitie of the emperour Augustus, haue offered
  in the capitoll vnto the gods presents or gifts, and haue ordeined
  the whole Ile in a manner to be appertinent, proper, and familiar to
  the Romans. They are burdened with sore customs which they paie for
  wares, either to be sent foorth into Gallia, or brought from thence,
  which are commonlie yuorie vessels, shéeres, ouches, or earerings,
  and other conceits made of amber &amp; glasses, and such like manner
  of merchandize: so that now there is no néed of anie armie or
  garrison of men of warre to kéepe the Ile, for there néedeth not past
  one legion of footmen, or some wing of horssemen, to gather vp and
  receiue the tribute: for the charges are rated according to the
  quantitie of the tributes: for otherwise it should be néedfull to
  abate the customs, if the tributes were also raised: and if anie
  violence should be vsed, it were dangerous least they might be
  prouoked to rebellion." Thus farre Strabo.</p>

  <h3>THE XIX. CHAPTER.</h3>

  <p><span class="rightnote">GUIDERIUS.</span> Guiderius the first
  sonne of Kymbeline (of whom Harison saieth nothing) began his reigne
  in the seuententh yeere after th' incarnation of Christ. This
  Guiderius being a man of stout courage, gaue occasion of breach of
  peace betwixt the Britains and Romans, denieng to paie them tribute,
  and procuring the people to new insurrections, which by one
  <span class="leftnote">Caligula.</span> meane or other made open
  rebellion, as Gyldas saith. Wherevpon the emperour Caligula (as some
  thinke) tooke occasion to leauie a power, and as one vtterlie
  misliking the negligence (as he called it) of Augustus and Tiberius
  his predecessors, he ment not onlie to reduce the Iland vnto the
  former subiection, but also to search out the vttermost bounds
  thereof, to the behoofe of himselfe, and of the Romane monarchie.</p>

  <p>Great prouision therefore was made by the said Caligula to
  performe that noble enterprise, and this was in the fourth yeere of
  his reigne. The like preparation was made on the other side by
  Guiderius, to resist the forren enimies, so that hauing all things in
  a readinesse, he ceassed not dailie to looke for the comming of the
  emperour, whome he ment to receiue <span class="rightnote"><br />
  <i>Dion Cassius. lib.</i> 59.</span> with hard enterteinment if he
  durst aduenture to set toward Britaine. But see the sequele: the
  maine armie being thus in a readinesse, departed from Rome in the 79
  yeere after the building of the citie, and marching foorth, at length
  came vnto the Belgike shore, from whence they might looke ouer, and
  behold the cliffes and coast of Britaine, which Caligula and
  his<span class="page">[<a name="page481" id="page481">Page
  481</a>]</span> men stood gazing vpon with great admiration and
  woonder.</p>

  <p>Furthermore he caused them to stand in battell arraie vpon the
  coast, where he heard how the Britains were in a redinesse to
  withstand his entrance. But entring into his gallie, as nothing
  discouraged with these newes, he rowed a flight shot or two from the
  shore, and forthwith returned, and then going vp into an high place
  like a pulpit, framed and set vp there for the nonce, he gaue the
  token to fight vnto his souldiers by sound of trumpet, and therewith
  was ech man charged to gather cockle shells vpon the shore, which he
  called the <span class="rightnote"><br />
  The spoile of the Ocean.</span> spoile of the Ocean, and caused them
  to be laid vp vntill a time conuenient. With the atchiuing of this
  exploit (as hauing none other wherewith to beautifie his triumph) he
  séemed greatlie exalted, thinking that now he had subdued the whole
  Ocean, and therefore highlie rewarded his souldiers for their paines
  susteined in that collection of cockle shells, as if they had doone
  him some notable péece of seruice. He also caried of the same shells
  with him to Rome, to the end he might there boast of his voyage, and
  brag how well he had sped: and required therefore verie earnestlie
  haue of * a triumph decreed vnto him for the accomplishment
  <span class="rightnote">* <i>sic.</i></span> of this enterprise.</p>

  <p>But when he saw the senat grudge at the free &amp; liberall
  granting of a grace in that behalfe, and perceiued how they refused
  to attribute diuine honors vnto him, in recompense of so foolish an
  enterprise, it wanted little that he had not slaine them euerie one.
  From thence therefore he went vp into a throne or royall seate, and
  calling therewith the common people about him, he told them a long
  tale what aduentures had chanced to him in his conquest of the Ocean.
  And when he had perceiued them to shout and crie, as if they had
  consented that he should haue béene a god for this his great trauell
  and valiant prowesse, he to increase their clamour, caused great
  quantities of gold &amp; siluer to be scattered amongst them, in the
  gathering whereof, manie were pressed to death, and diuers also
  slaine with the inuenomed caltrops of iron, which he did cast out
  with the same monie, of purpose to doo mischiefe, the same caltrops
  being in forme small &amp; sharp, so that by reason of the prease of
  people, much hurt was doone by them yer they were perceiued. And this
  was the end of the ridiculous voiage of Caligula attempted against
  the Britains.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><i>Suetonius.</i></span> But after the
  death of this Caligula, the emperour Claudius (as Suetonius saith)
  moued warre against the Britains, because of a sturre and rebellion
  raised in that land, for that such fugitiues as were fled from
  thence, were not againe restored when request was made for the
  same.</p>

  <p><span class="rightnote"><br />
  Dion Cassius.</span> Dion Cassius writeth, that one Bericus, being
  expelled out of Britaine, persuaded the emperour Claudius to take the
  warre in hand at this time against the Britains, so that one Aulus
  Plautius a senatour, and as then pretor, was appointed to take the
  armie that soiourned in France then called Gallia, and to passe ouer
  with the same into Britaine. The souldiers hearing of this voiage,
  were loth to go with him, as men not willing to make warre in another
  world: and therefore delaied time, till at length one Narcissus was
  sent from Claudius, as it were to appease the souldiers, &amp;
  procure them to set forward. But when this Narcissus went vp into the
  tribunall throne of Plautius, to declare the cause of his comming,
  the souldiers taking great indignation therewith cried, <i>O
  Saturnalia,</i> as if they should haue celebrated their feast daie so
  called.</p>

  <p>When the seruants apparelled in their maisters robes, represented
  the roome of their maisters, and were serued by them, as if they had
  béene their seruants, and thus at length constreined, through verie
  shame, they agréed to follow Plautius. Herevpon being embarked, he
  diuided his nauie into thrée parts, to the end that if they were kept
  off from arriuing in one place, yet they might take land in another.
  The ships suffered some impeachment in their passage by a contrarie
  wind that droue them backe againe: but yet the marriners and men of
  warre taking good courage vnto them, the rather because there was
  séene a fierie leame to shoot out of the east towards the west, which
  way their course lay, made forwards againe with their ships, and
  landed without finding anie resistance. For the Britains looked not
  for their comming: wherefore, when they heard how their enimies
  were<span class="page">[<a name="page482" id="page482">Page

  trusting that by lingering of time the Romans would be constreined to
  depart, as it had chanced in time past to Iulius Cesar aforesaid.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
